The Local Kitchen & Ale,"Quick Post: 5 star!!! Loved it, and will definitely be back!

Long post: I visited this place back when they first opened, and even though it was good, I wasn't impressed with the options given and with a picky husband it was hard to select. Husband and I decided to try it last night. I had learned that they changed their menu up. Let me just say this place was top notch. I already knew the atmosphere was nice and cozy, made you feel relaxed and comfortable. We walked in feeling like we were welcome and appreciated! We both opted for the pasta dishes, him the spaghetti and me the alfredo, both came with side salads and we chose an extra order of the garlic knots. This food y'all! Let me tell you! IT WAS AMAZING! I am Italian and can be picky about my pasta dishes. Both dishes were just full of flavor and substance! The Alfredo was creamy and just perfect! The noodles were cooked to perfection! They were not crunchy and they didn't just fall apart in your mouth. My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs, again the noodles cooked to perfection, and the sauce was great! The meatballs were huge and cooked all the way through. The portions were big, one could easily leave with leftovers. Not us though, way to good to stop eating it! I love that they had other finger food options if you just wanted a snack and a beer. Or you could do the pasta for a nice date night, like the husband and I chose.  I can not say enough about this place! The prices were reasonable especially for what we got, and the owner was so nice. I kinda stuck my foot in my mouth when i asked if he had been there since they opened because i didn't care for the menu before. He politely said yes he didn't have a choice since he was the owner. lol Oh my! oops! he then explained how much time and effort he has put into this establishment hiring a chef from culinary school and revamping the menu to meet needs and cut down waste. Ya'll!!! It was great! Thank you Local Kitchen & Ale for sticking it out. I will be back!",Valid,"This is a detailed, genuine review describing a specific dining experience at the restaurant.

Sonic Drive-In,We were dining out front and they cut the lights out on my family without warning.  They literally served our food to us knowing that we we're sitting out at the patios and put us out in the dark.  I would not have cared if we didn't have 5 little ones running around. But having small children running around like that we needed a lit parking lot. We even asked for them to turn them back on so that we could get our stuff together and they refused to do so. I understand that they may be young and they may not have kids and don't understand. But being an outside dining area This was a very poor choice of the person in charge! They could have been responsible for someone getting hurt!  We will not be returning to this location and I would not recommend it to anyone else.,Valid,"The review describes a genuine dining experience at Sonic Drive-In, detailing a specific incident about outdoor lighting being turned off while the family was eating at the patio area.
