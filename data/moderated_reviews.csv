Roots Handmade Pizza - South Loop,"5 stars for: service, atmosphere, ambiance
3 stars for: pizza
10 stars: mozzarella sticks, alcoholic popsicles

Pros; It’s not often downtown you find a decent selection of wines for under $50, was super impressed with the bottle we got and it was $36. The rooftop is amazing, the venue is amazing!!! Open spaces, disco ball, awesome music and an all around perfect environment. The mozzarella sticks were TO DIE FOR CHEESE LOVERS BEWARE !! Huge mozz sticks packed with flavor and the menu didn’t lie, unforgettable! Alcoholic popsicles for dessert were a huge treat but I should have gone with the fruity pebble cheesecake WOW!

Pizza - a ton of specialty ethnic pizzas that are sure to please unique palettes. However, I was craving an authentic Italian pizza so that’s what I went with (garden pizza add sausage for a supreme pizza creation) and  was quite disappointed. Sausage lovers beware - the sausage is on the pizza like ground meat which was a huge turn off for me. Light sauce and the cheese would pretty lightly cooked so it didn’t give that mooey gooey feel. Other pizzas that came out looked great and the staff was more than willing to make us a new one which I appreciated but it just wasn’t our vibe. I would come back and try something else next time!! Overall great visit and would recommend.",Valid,"This is a comprehensive, genuine review of a dining experience at Roots Handmade Pizza.

Beatrix,"Highly recommend Beatrix!

We came on a Saturday night for one of my best friends birthday dinner celebration. I strongly recommend making a reservation! To get seated, make sure your party is there. You can make reservations through OpenTable and collect those points!

During the pandemic, they closed “w Fulton market” street and all of the restaurants have outdoor seating and pods available. I thought this was a great idea and it’s going to be so nice for warmer weather nights in the Chi. We did sit inside. All staff did have on mask and hand sanitizer is available. Guests are required to wear masks while in the restaurant, masks are required during all interactions with the service team and only to be removed when eating or drinking. Before seating, all guest did have our temperature checked. They have digital menus and it does say On their menu, to help offset restrictions on their business resulting from the pandemic, there is a a 5% surcharge added to the check. Similar to other restaurants you can let them know if you want it removed.

The ambiance is chic, dimmed lighting and the space is well-decorated. I loved the light fixtures, I’m weird! The tables were spaced apart, so we didn’t feel as if we were on top of anyone which was nice. The chairs for the round table were ether cushioned or non, all very comfortable.

They had a great selection of beverages and wine list. My friends and I all participated in the restaurant week menu. This is $39 per person and the dinner menu is available daily after 4:00PM. You get to select one of their starters, entrees and dessert, as well as one their cocktails listed. This was such a great deal and I highly recommend to take advantage of it! The portions were perfect for one person or even if you wanted to share so the other guest can order something different too.

In our party, for the starters we tried their hummus which came with a delicious fresh tomatoes and cucumber salad, flavorful hummus and warm naan. I was hesitant about combining the cold tomatoes on top of the hummus/naan, but it was so delicious! We also tried their local burrata with roasted beets and crispy quinoa. I am personally not a beets person, but two of our friends in our party enjoyed it. The only con was, they wanted more of the bread.

For entrees, one of our friends tried their Cavatelli with chicken bolognese and the remaining of our party ordered the skirt steak chimichurri. Both dishes were cooked perfectly and had flavor, they were delicious! The skirt steaks came with fries and grilled shishito peppers. The peppers were a good combo with the steak as they were bit smoky, but they didn’t have spice to them. I do enjoy spice, so I would have liked that, but even so still a delicious combination. The entrees were a good size portion, good to eat alone or again to share (COVID friendly of course).

For dessert, we tried their oh my! Carmel pie, and the pie definitely fits the name. Oh my, oh my, it was fantastic. I am normally not a caramel person and when I first saw the pie I was like oh great look how thick this is I’m not going to eat it and it is complete opposite! It was so smooth and creamy! And the shortbread cookie crust was my favorite part. We also tried their chocolate cake which was very heavy, but delicious! I highly recommend either dessert, and the side of whip cream I would say it is, but obviously made better was very much appreciated!

Our server was fantastic, sadly I didn’t get his name and I don’t have my Receipt. He was very friendly and made sure we were good all night. Since my friend did not want a  candle for her birthday or to sing, he did give my friend a to-go dessert which was very sweet and made her feel special.",Valid,"This is a comprehensive and detailed review of a genuine dining experience at Beatrix.

The Centre for Oral Surgery in Joliet,"This was an absolutely amazing experience!  My oldest son needed 4 impacted molars removed, and I was not pleased with the reviews of the places recommended by his dentist and orthodontist and found this place myself.

They were incredibly thorough in making sure they had all the paperwork, x-rays and other models before the event.  We were given a care package prior to the surgery (something we purchased) to assist in reducing the swelling and to clean the wounds.

We had a meeting prior to the surgery which covered everything that was going to happen with a clear outline of the process, paper work, and billing.

The day itself was so smooth it was amazing.  We arrived a little before the scheduled time, my son was seen around 20 minutes later, and the surgery itself was estimated to be 45 minutes and it was.  We were in an out much quicker than I had expected.  In addition to that, I was able to get all necessary meds at a vending machine (InstyMeds) after the surgery very easily.

My son had a headwrap for the ice packs, we were given extra gauze, chapstick for the  chapped lips that occur during the procedure, extra ice packs, documentation to go home, and even a blanket to take with us!  Anesthesia can give you the shivers so that was an amazing touch.  We received meds for the pain, anti biotics, and meds to help the swelling, which should make this process as pleasant as one can hope to expect.

Our appointment was at 8:40 and I believe we were home before 11!  Very efficient in every detail!
