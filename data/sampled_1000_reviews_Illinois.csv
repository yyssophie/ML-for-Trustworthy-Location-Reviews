I think I'd go back just to order the wings because they were DELISH! Although, I ordered the BBQ sauce on the side and the cook put the sauce on it.

Because it was a group of us and we ordered various items to share, I must say that their nachos are made fresh, and this was the upside to it. The downside, I thought the ground beef was under seasoned, but I'd order it without meat next time.

Not sure what the regular crowd is like on a Friday, but the night I went it was pretty light, perhaps because of the threat of snow.

This location, at least, is the most uninspired grocery store I have seen. The prices were higher than any competitor - the Jewel in Zion is a far better choice. The selection of Bob's Red Mill products was pathetic. The only intriguing item we bought was a package of bakery dept. toffee cookies.

Here are just a few price comparisons. Food Club 100% Apple Juice was on sale for $1.79 - we buy this everywhere else on sale for $1.00. Fiber One bars were insanely overpriced - when Meijer has a special buy any 5 mix and match sale, I can get these for $1.49! The Rock Star drinks were on sale at 3 for $4.00, but the normal price was $1.79. These are frequently on sale at Jewel for $1.00. The regular price for theater-sized candy was $1.49. You can buy these for $1.00 at Dollar Tree and just about every major grocery chain for $1.00 or less when they have sales.

3 stars for: pizza
10 stars: mozzarella sticks, alcoholic popsicles

Pros; It’s not often downtown you find a decent selection of wines for under $50, was super impressed with the bottle we got and it was $36. The rooftop is amazing, the venue is amazing!!! Open spaces, disco ball, awesome music and an all around perfect environment. The mozzarella sticks were TO DIE FOR CHEESE LOVERS BEWARE !! Huge mozz sticks packed with flavor and the menu didn’t lie, unforgettable! Alcoholic popsicles for dessert were a huge treat but I should have gone with the fruity pebble cheesecake WOW!

Pizza - a ton of specialty ethnic pizzas that are sure to please unique palettes. However, I was craving an authentic Italian pizza so that’s what I went with (garden pizza add sausage for a supreme pizza creation) and  was quite disappointed. Sausage lovers beware - the sausage is on the pizza like ground meat which was a huge turn off for me. Light sauce and the cheese would pretty lightly cooked so it didn’t give that mooey gooey feel. Other pizzas that came out looked great and the staff was more than willing to make us a new one which I appreciated but it just wasn’t our vibe. I would come back and try something else next time!! Overall great visit and would recommend.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnPZIxGY733NfZ0RUixJ0N4IbpxStksxkJDgtR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqybDJ0cQUsgBRZlglKVdpW9qnyyHwIO0HwYkP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]","{'time': 1595258193805, 'text': ""Hello Carole,\n\nThank you for the review.

Our crumbled sausage is part of the Quad Cities tradition.  It is cooked and cooled and we drain the excess grease and double grind our sausage for a lighter texture.  It is a departure from the Chicago style sausage and many of our guests love it, I'm sorry it was a turn off for you.

It is also humongous in size! It would be a perfect place to entertain a large crowd. I have a lot of family in Champaign and would not mind bringing them all here for a mini reunion and some good food.
If I could change anything about this place I would ask them to add more interior lighting.

116419456537217402145,Dani C,1616950804982,5,"Highly recommend Beatrix!

We came on a Saturday night for one of my best friends birthday dinner celebration. I strongly recommend making a reservation! To get seated, make sure your party is there. You can make reservations through OpenTable and collect those points!

During the pandemic, they closed “w Fulton market” street and all of the restaurants have outdoor seating and pods available. I thought this was a great idea and it’s going to be so nice for warmer weather nights in the Chi. We did sit inside. All staff did have on mask and hand sanitizer is available. Guests are required to wear masks while in the restaurant, masks are required during all interactions with the service team and only to be removed when eating or drinking. Before seating, all guest did have our temperature checked. They have digital menus and it does say On their menu, to help offset restrictions on their business resulting from the pandemic, there is a a 5% surcharge added to the check. Similar to other restaurants you can let them know if you want it removed.

The ambiance is chic, dimmed lighting and the space is well-decorated. I loved the light fixtures, I’m weird! The tables were spaced apart, so we didn’t feel as if we were on top of anyone which was nice. The chairs for the round table were ether cushioned or non, all very comfortable.

They had a great selection of beverages and wine list. My friends and I all participated in the restaurant week menu. This is $39 per person and the dinner menu is available daily after 4:00PM. You get to select one of their starters, entrees and dessert, as well as one their cocktails listed. This was such a great deal and I highly recommend to take advantage of it! The portions were perfect for one person or even if you wanted to share so the other guest can order something different too.

In our party, for the starters we tried their hummus which came with a delicious fresh tomatoes and cucumber salad, flavorful hummus and warm naan. I was hesitant about combining the cold tomatoes on top of the hummus/naan, but it was so delicious! We also tried their local burrata with roasted beets and crispy quinoa. I am personally not a beets person, but two of our friends in our party enjoyed it. The only con was, they wanted more of the bread.

For entrees, one of our friends tried their Cavatelli with chicken bolognese and the remaining of our party ordered the skirt steak chimichurri. Both dishes were cooked perfectly and had flavor, they were delicious! The skirt steaks came with fries and grilled shishito peppers. The peppers were a good combo with the steak as they were bit smoky, but they didn’t have spice to them. I do enjoy spice, so I would have liked that, but even so still a delicious combination. The entrees were a good size portion, good to eat alone or again to share (COVID friendly of course).

For dessert, we tried their oh my! Carmel pie, and the pie definitely fits the name. Oh my, oh my, it was fantastic. I am normally not a caramel person and when I first saw the pie I was like oh great look how thick this is I’m not going to eat it and it is complete opposite! It was so smooth and creamy! And the shortbread cookie crust was my favorite part. We also tried their chocolate cake which was very heavy, but delicious! I highly recommend either dessert, and the side of whip cream I would say it is, but obviously made better was very much appreciated!

Our server was fantastic, sadly I didn’t get his name and I don’t have my Receipt. He was very friendly and made sure we were good all night. Since my friend did not want a  candle for her birthday or to sing, he did give my friend a to-go dessert which was very sweet and made her feel special.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPORdh7w3_V-5Y1BbJOQ2qOkcT6qr3r8ZK1W--5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6bOGDgxbBdkr4YQKqw_r2kmcMi74yIRsmY-q8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9XXG-pHntt0mKt0RJ1iQ3fZaH3Vx-DjKMntjP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMirsXHxVpLVY3pVGKmWrzOKJEOT8WMVDtR5M7v=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlb3Obl2b7CkH6JDlKxHXP0o0AkxQYZtLANSYo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCGEFmXGKkfcZKc22w-FEz0PLlmZmadMqka-EL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgTYXEPjImA7D-HEjMghheJ4B0HA9s2mN_Od_h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPefosvSbG1rm8Wixwf8sQZv2vxKHGB_KqV3Lg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",,0x880e2cd03d0fc8a1:0xe2cff1992db6b1c3,677

My partner and I dropped in on a weekday for a cocktail and ended up having two rounds on account of how much we enjoyed our first. Our bartender was awesome.

I had the Corpse Reviver #2 since I’ve been on a gin kick lately. I gotta say, this might be my nee favorite cocktail within .5 miles of my apartment. That’s dangerous.

My partner was sipping on some delicious whiskey cocktails. Their cocktail menu will hit the spot for any variety of drinker. They have beer, too, if I’m not mistaken.

For my second round, the very helpful bartender suggested a similar cocktail that used to be on their menu for me since I wanted to mix it up and stick with a similar gin recipe. It was equally well-made yet didn’t excite me like the first cocktail. I love the use of fresh ingredients, premium spirits and thoughtful recipes.

It was quiet when we went, which was nice, actually.

Don’t change, Weegee’s. I’ll be back soon.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWB_0j82ndt-FFvWjN2tJ5RLRPradRWC1Cj1NC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJvjUHmi_tAJEW7ZPOokU83IwX1udtHHCDs0R0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIft_z2654ZrftPaCVg-JWfQEyTPdQp3dnjWP6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",,0x880fcd1562c755f5:0x45971643e95e4d0d,191

Make sure everyone in your group is ready to be seated, they won't seat you otherwise.

For what you are getting the food is a little over priced. Smaller portions than back in the day that made the place popular. The service is always rushed, not much you can do about that with every table filled.

Customers are commonly vaping pot around the premises and the skunky odor couldn't be more obvious....so uncool considering their is a Junior High School 50 feet across the street! Hmmm....Who puts a Vape shop 50 feet from a School...You guessed it CREEPY people! This is a New Era Head Shop that masquerades as a smoking cessation boutique and has the public fooled beyond belief! These devices are dual purpose just like a hookah or bong was billed for years! An ADULT store such as this has NO business being in such close proximity to a school and the patrons that frequent this place should be ashamed of themselves for their conduct. This sends a horrible message to our kids in the community and it is certainly not helping the major vaping issue going on in the Junior High across the street where 6th graders get busted regularly for Vapes in the school bathrooms!

The excuse was, we just reopened. Don't open if you're not prepared. Then they served us with plastic forks and knives, like you would expect from the county fair or a food truck. The water cups were flimsy bud light  cups with no lids for children. The first small basket of salsa and chips are complimentary after that it's $3 each basket. For a family of five the first basket was two chips each person. The food was overcooked and dried out.  When we asked for more napkins, the sarcastic response was to use our sleeves. Not exactly funny when everything else had issues   Needless to say, I'm not going back.",,,0x880e57c7820a21b7:0x74ff1e2225d2ccdc,137

106477401824616980388,Amy Kouba,1564872935670,5,"This was an absolutely amazing experience!  My oldest son needed 4 impacted molars removed, and I was not pleased with the reviews of the places recommended by his dentist and orthodontist and found this place myself.

They were incredibly thorough in making sure they had all the paperwork, x-rays and other models before the event.  We were given a care package prior to the surgery (something we purchased) to assist in reducing the swelling and to clean the wounds.

We had a meeting prior to the surgery which covered everything that was going to happen with a clear outline of the process, paper work, and billing.

The day itself was so smooth it was amazing.  We arrived a little before the scheduled time, my son was seen around 20 minutes later, and the surgery itself was estimated to be 45 minutes and it was.  We were in an out much quicker than I had expected.  In addition to that, I was able to get all necessary meds at a vending machine (InstyMeds) after the surgery very easily.

My son had a headwrap for the ice packs, we were given extra gauze, chapstick for the  chapped lips that occur during the procedure, extra ice packs, documentation to go home, and even a blanket to take with us!  Anesthesia can give you the shivers so that was an amazing touch.  We received meds for the pain, anti biotics, and meds to help the swelling, which should make this process as pleasant as one can hope to expect.

Our appointment was at 8:40 and I believe we were home before 11!  Very efficient in every detail!  I am totally glad we went with this centre.",,"{'time': 1565039983925, 'text': 'Thank you so much Amy.  We are so happy to have been here for your son and to make him feel comfortable.
