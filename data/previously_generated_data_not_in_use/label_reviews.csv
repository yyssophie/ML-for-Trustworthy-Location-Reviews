Because it was a group of us and we ordered various items to share, I must say that their nachos are made fresh, and this was the upside to it. The downside, I thought the ground beef was under seasoned, but I'd order it without meat next time.

The prices were higher than any competitor - the Jewel in Zion is a far better choice. The selection of Bob's Red Mill products was pathetic. The only intriguing item we bought was a package of bakery dept. toffee cookies.

Here are just a few price comparisons. Food Club 100% Apple Juice was on sale for $1.79 - we buy this everywhere else on sale for $1.00. Fiber One bars were insanely overpriced - when Meijer has a special buy any 5 mix and match sale, I can get these for $1.49! The Rock Star drinks were on sale at 3 for $4.00, but the normal price was $1.79. These are frequently on sale at Jewel for $1.00. The regular price for theater-sized candy was $1.49. You can buy these for $1.00 at Dollar Tree and just about every major grocery chain for $1.00 or less when they have sales.

Roots Handmade Pizza - South Loop,"5 stars for: service, atmosphere, ambiance
3 stars for: pizza
10 stars: mozzarella sticks, alcoholic popsicles

Pros; It’s not often downtown you find a decent selection of wines for under $50, was super impressed with the bottle we got and it was $36. The rooftop is amazing, the venue is amazing!!! Open spaces, disco ball, awesome music and an all around perfect environment. The mozzarella sticks were TO DIE FOR CHEESE LOVERS BEWARE !! Huge mozz sticks packed with flavor and the menu didn’t lie, unforgettable! Alcoholic popsicles for dessert were a huge treat but I should have gone with the fruity pebble cheesecake WOW!

Pizza - a ton of specialty ethnic pizzas that are sure to please unique palettes. However, I was craving an authentic Italian pizza so that’s what I went with (garden pizza add sausage for a supreme pizza creation) and  was quite disappointed. Sausage lovers beware - the sausage is on the pizza like ground meat which was a huge turn off for me. Light sauce and the cheese would pretty lightly cooked so it didn’t give that mooey gooey feel. Other pizzas that came out looked great and the staff was more than willing to make us a new one which I appreciated but it just wasn’t our vibe. I would come back and try something else next time!!

My favorites were the fried chicken wings and mozzarella sticks. My husband got the gyro plate and it looked so good I wanted to eat it, and I hate gyro. LOL

It is also humongous in size! It would be a perfect place to entertain a large crowd. I have a lot of family in Champaign and would not mind bringing them all here for a mini reunion and some good food.
If I could change anything about this place I would ask them to add more interior lighting.

Beatrix,"Highly recommend Beatrix!

We came on a Saturday night for one of my best friends birthday dinner celebration. I strongly recommend making a reservation! To get seated, make sure your party is there. You can make reservations through OpenTable and collect those points!

During the pandemic, they closed “w Fulton market” street and all of the restaurants have outdoor seating and pods available. I thought this was a great idea and it’s going to be so nice for warmer weather nights in the Chi. We did sit inside. All staff did have on mask and hand sanitizer is available. Guests are required to wear masks while in the restaurant, masks are required during all interactions with the service team and only to be removed when eating or drinking. Before seating, all guest did have our temperature checked. They have digital menus and it does say On their menu, to help offset restrictions on their business resulting from the pandemic, there is a a 5% surcharge added to the check. Similar to other restaurants you can let them know if you want it removed.

The ambiance is chic, dimmed lighting and the space is well-decorated. I loved the light fixtures, I’m weird! The tables were spaced apart, so we didn’t feel as if we were on top of anyone which was nice. The chairs for the round table were ether cushioned or non, all very comfortable.

They had a great selection of beverages and wine list. My friends and I all participated in the restaurant week menu. This is $39 per person and the dinner menu is available daily after 4:00PM. You get to select one of their starters, entrees and dessert, as well as one their cocktails listed. This was such a great deal and I highly recommend to take advantage of it! The portions were perfect for one person or even if you wanted to share so the other guest can order something different too.

In our party, for the starters we tried their hummus which came with a delicious fresh tomatoes and cucumber salad, flavorful hummus and warm naan. I was hesitant about combining the cold tomatoes on top of the hummus/naan, but it was so delicious! We also tried their local burrata with roasted beets and crispy quinoa. I am personally not a beets person, but two of our friends in our party enjoyed it. The only con was, they wanted more of the bread.

For entrees, one of our friends tried their Cavatelli with chicken bolognese and the remaining of our party ordered the skirt steak chimichurri. Both dishes were cooked perfectly and had flavor, they were delicious! The skirt steaks came with fries and grilled shishito peppers. The peppers were a good combo with the steak as they were bit smoky, but they didn’t have spice to them. I do enjoy spice, so I would have liked that, but even so still a delicious combination. The entrees were a good size portion, good to eat alone or again to share (COVID friendly of course).

For dessert, we tried their oh my! Carmel pie, and the pie definitely fits the name. Oh my, oh my, it was fantastic. I am normally not a caramel person and when I first saw the pie I was like oh great look how thick this is I’m not going to eat it and it is complete opposite! It was so smooth and creamy! And the shortbread cookie crust was my favorite part. We also tried their chocolate cake which was very heavy, but delicious! I highly recommend either dessert, and the side of whip cream I would say it is, but obviously made better was very much appreciated!

Our server was fantastic, sadly I didn’t get his name and I don’t have my Receipt. He was very friendly and made sure we were good all night. Since my friend did not want a  candle for her birthday or to sing, he did give my friend a to-go dessert which was very sweet and made her feel special.",Awaiting Input,Currently awaiting JSON input to process.,,,

My partner and I dropped in on a weekday for a cocktail and ended up having two rounds on account of how much we enjoyed our first. Our bartender was awesome.

I had the Corpse Reviver #2 since I’ve been on a gin kick lately. I gotta say, this might be my nee favorite cocktail within .5 miles of my apartment. That’s dangerous.

My partner was sipping on some delicious whiskey cocktails. Their cocktail menu will hit the spot for any variety of drinker. They have beer, too, if I’m not mistaken.

For my second round, the very helpful bartender suggested a similar cocktail that used to be on their menu for me since I wanted to mix it up and stick with a similar gin recipe. It was equally well-made yet didn’t excite me like the first cocktail. I love the use of fresh ingredients, premium spirits and thoughtful recipes.

It was quiet when we went, which was nice, actually.

An ADULT store such as this has NO business being in such close proximity to a school and the patrons that frequent this place should be ashamed of themselves for their conduct.

Potter's Place and Two-Nine Martini Lounge,"What a disappointment for a restaurant in downton Naperville. They were out of most of what we wanted to order of the menu, nothing to exotic. The excuse was, we just reopened. Don't open if you're not prepared. Then they served us with plastic forks and knives, like you would expect from the county fair or a food truck. The water cups were flimsy bud light  cups with no lids for children. The first small basket of salsa and chips are complimentary after that it's $3 each basket. For a family of five the first basket was two chips each person. The food was overcooked and dried out.  When we asked for more napkins, the sarcastic response was to use our sleeves.

The Centre for Oral Surgery in Joliet,"This was an absolutely amazing experience!  My oldest son needed 4 impacted molars removed, and I was not pleased with the reviews of the places recommended by his dentist and orthodontist and found this place myself.

They were incredibly thorough in making sure they had all the paperwork, x-rays and other models before the event.  We were given a care package prior to the surgery (something we purchased) to assist in reducing the swelling and to clean the wounds.

We had a meeting prior to the surgery which covered everything that was going to happen with a clear outline of the process, paper work, and billing.

The day itself was so smooth it was amazing.  We arrived a little before the scheduled time, my son was seen around 20 minutes later, and the surgery itself was estimated to be 45 minutes and it was.  We were in an out much quicker than I had expected.  In addition to that, I was able to get all necessary meds at a vending machine (InstyMeds) after the surgery very easily.

My son had a headwrap for the ice packs, we were given extra gauze, chapstick for the  chapped lips that occur during the procedure, extra ice packs, documentation to go home, and even a blanket to take with us!  Anesthesia can give you the shivers so that was an amazing touch.  We received meds for the pain, anti biotics, and meds to help the swelling, which should make this process as pleasant as one can hope to expect.

Our appointment was at 8:40 and I believe we were home before 11!  Very efficient in every detail!  I am totally glad we went with this centre.",,,,,

Shogun,"We go here about once a year.  Always for a ""special occasion"".   This time was no different.  We went to celebrate our friend David leaving us.  We arrived to a ZOO, at best.  We had reservations for 6:30.  We were given a beeper, and told to WAIT.  Yea, stand up and WAIT with the other 50 people.  No place to sit.  AND, not bar service.  Just stand and WAIT.  A bit of a stupid business decision, as they could have sold us 3 drinks.

EVENTUALLY we were called.  6:50 for our 6:30 reservation.  We were seated with a nice couple, and 4 ladies.  The couple was out on a ""date"".  Dressed to the nines, and holding hands.  The ladies looked like they had come from a soccer game, as they were dressed in dirty jeans and t-shirts.  A bit strange, but each to their own.

Our server was NOT into his job, tonight.  NO show.  No production.  Just cut to the chase and make the food.  He seemed quite over-worked.  He was a bit flustered by all the ""special"" requests.  Things like no shrimp, no noodles, give mine to him/her, etc.  He messed up the couple's order three times.   He was flirting with the girls - although they did keep referring to my son, my husband.  He divided food a bit heavy towards the girls, but hard to tell as they were the PICKIEST eaters I have seen.  Not a one of them could eat the meal as provided.  They alll had to omit or swap some food item.   This is NOT the place for custom cooked food.
One of the ladies then went BALISTIC!!!!   Laid into the guy.  Yelled, screamed, all with the back-up choir of her friends.
The gentleman tried to explain his position.  He then appologized.  She would not accept his apology and kept on screaming.

As we left, the building we were accosted in the parking lot by one of the ladies husbands.  He physically threw our friend to the ground.   The manger did come out.  He managed to get the guy to leave.  The wife was crying.  The manager again, said he was sorry.  NOW he knew he had incorrectly identified WHO was the problem.

By now many reading this want to know why I fault the restaurant, and why the bad review for OTHER PEOPLE's behavior.   SOOOOO......

Shogun OVER-BOOKED that night.  It was ONLY 6:30 and they were 20 mins behind.   They put too many people at the table.  They did not have adeuate staff, or resources for the number of people.  They got GREEDY.

They also were taking ANYONE.   The women were NOT dressed appropriately for this restaurant.   The simply did not belong.  They were not there for the show and fancy experience this restaurant offers.  It is the ONLY reason one would pay $25 - $30 a plate for this food.

The manager removed the WRONG people.  The cook did not do a great job, and then it was improperly addressed. This is Shogun's problem.

In the end the couple will likely never return.
It is 99% probable that the three of us will not return.
Will four ladies go out on the town, husbandless, in the near future.  I doubt that too.
Shogun aleniated five people, and MIGHT get the four to return.  And when they do they will act like jerks again.

I had the fish and chips, which was ok. The chips were think cut attempts at kettle chips, not fries, showing a lack of understanding of the dish. It wasn't seasoned to speak of, not even the chips.

They were also out of green beans and ice cream. Just weird.

The Second City,"JC One Liner Review:  Comedy starts here.

I had a great time here with a group of friends watching a stand-up.  We took a tour of this place and learned that you could take a stand-up comedy class.

There is a good amount of history of how many actors and actresses have gone through this comedy club - for example, Tina Fey or Steve Carell.

Heck, you don’t have to learn or know anything about this place because it is an excellent choice for a date night or a group of friends.

The Plush Horse - Now Open INSIDE for CARRYOUT,"I just want to give The Plush Horse Ice Cream Shop 5 stars for adapting to COVID-19 with an excellent curb-side service.  I got a recommendation to go there for homemade ice cream and upon arriving found out how it worked.  In the parking lot there is a special row of curbside only parking spaces with signs that are numbered.  Park there and if you need a menu, there was an outdoor stand with individual flyers that list everything they sell.  I was amazed at all the different flavors of ice cream they handle.  It took a few minutes for our car to read it all to decide.  Then call in your order, pay over the phone with a credit card or they will take cash when they deliver your items.  When ready your order is delivered to the car window.  Everything was bagged extremely well, and also came with a coupon for a free jr cone and also a small bottle of hand cleaner on Halloween & attached to the bag which was a very nice idea on Halloween.  Their cones are served upside down in a cup (see my photo).  We decided on Strawberry Waffle Cone, Hot Fudge Sunday and Cotton Candy Ice Cream in a cup.",Valid,"The review provides a clear description of a positive experience at the location, which aligns with the 5-star rating.

Hofbräuhaus Chicago,"Luckily for Hofbrauhaus I'm writing the review few days later, otherwise it would have been 1 or 2 stars.

Basically the Beer and pretzels are good.  Everything else is mediocre at best - talking about food here.

The sausages are basically hot dogs and are very rubbery.   You get better ""sausage"" at Costco for $1.50 with drink then here for $15 minus the drink.   But we're not here for the value but for German experience, sitting in huge hall next to strangers at the same table and with music so laud you can't talk to each other, and for that I must say it's probably as good as it can get in USA, so 3 stars for that.

Skyway Doghouse,"For a little bit of background first I have had hot dogs all over the Chicagoland area and I have developed pretty good taste for it. To be honest this dog was not better or worse than other places that make a true Chicago style hot dog. I'm pretty sure everyone thinks it's awesome, because it's been there for a really long time and there is something good to say about that. The fries looked a little soggy, but they actually tasted pretty good. I do want to say that I did not think the dog was bad by any means it was still very very good and has the consistency of a true Chicago dog place. I would have them work on the presentation of the fries. They did look pretty soggy, and if they were a bit more crispy I think we would really have something then.",Valid,"The review provides specific feedback about the product color, size, and user experience which is relevant to the category 'handcrafts'.

Nico Osteria,"This restaurant is located within the lobby of the Chicago Thompson Hotel.  The upside to this is a lovely, close-by space in which to enjoy a pre- or post-dinner cocktail off of their menu.  The downside is that a trip to the bathroom requires a trek:  down a flight of stairs, behind a strange door off to the right of the host stand.

Everything we ordered from the menu was delicious and perfectly prepared; our server explained how to choose selections from the unusual menu, and had us order everything (except dessert) upfront, so the flow from the kitchen could be paced accordingly.  The market-price Branzino was a splurge, but did not disappoint!  The only thing that could have improved the experience was the attention to detail by some of the servers -- such as setting the table with plates and utensils before, or simultaneously with the presentation of the appetizer and dessert courses.  They did not appear short on servers during the night we went, but it seemed as though some were pulling more than their share of the weight, due to the inexperience of others.  The seating at the tables was a tight squeeze--so much so that it almost felt communal (with no way to not listen in on your neighbors' conversations, or for them to not hear yours!)  I will most likely return, but not until the service issues are ironed-out AND I can confirm I will enjoy my meal from one of the booths, which offer more privacy.",Irrelevant,The text 'Not good food.' is very short and does not provide specific details about the business.

"Museum of Science and Industry, Chicago","This review is written from the perspective of an adult visiting with another adult, and visiting again after several visits over many years.

Given that, the sheer number of children to be navigated around, when you're not visiting with children of your own, was a bit distracting. And although new exhibits have been added, enough is the same over the years that some of the ""wow"" factor has been dulled over time.

Note that we went specifically for the Mythbusters exhibit, and were greatly disappointed by the small size, the lack of any real substance to the exhibit, and the additional cost that gave little in return.

I think it's still a great place to visit as a first-timer, and definitely with children, but as an adult who's made the trip numerous times before, I think there is little left to offer.",Valid,"The review describes an experience with the food and staff in a positive light, which is relevant to a dining location with a consistent 5-star rating.",,,

Grand Bear Resort at Starved Rock,"Amazing experience, family friendly, helpful people, price is right, and starved rock right there across the street!! 2017.

Update 2018 Holiday.
We had a bad experience and won't come back, after we booked several weeks prior to Christmas we were told the pool would not be working (weeks after we booked), we were ok with that, they also promised all of the other amenities weather permitting available and additional activities for the kids, well, that didn't happened, movies closed, mini golf dirty with sticks and leaves all over couldn't play without the balls getting stuck inside the pipes we manually removed the leaves, the restaurant had odd hours due to lack of customers, they kept the cafeteria closed the whole stayed which was about 4 days, we were never informed it was going to be this way.
When we checked in I was charged the stay twice, and there was a discrepancy with the charges made to the point that I couldn't do room charged because the ladies were confused, I went to have breakfast came back and they were still trying to figure it out, I had to call my bank to get my money back, after about 3 hours of dealing with this situation, I was given free complementary passes for breakfast buffet a special event for Christmas they were hosting, the menu stated pancakes and other  food items, we went to eat that morning and were told the pancakes were for lunch not breakfast ????.

The suite we stayed at had a broken bed and I had to take a pain pill for my back next morning, the carpet was so black and filthy we couldn't walk with our socks on without them getting black in the bottom with just a few steps And I wish I was exaggerating, the cable TV was only in 1 out of 3 TVs, and for story time the hunter and the bear didn't even moved, the kids were so bored!
We had to drive to the next town to get food because as I stated, the restaurant was closed most part of the day, at night the bar closed due to no customers.
I emailed Jacky D. and she forearms my email to the front desk manager I got a call from her while I was working and couldn't pick up, I called her back and was told she was not available, I do not have her email or any other form of contact, it would have been easier to emailed me.
Anyways, I wish they will inform customers that due to lack of customers (during certain seasons) most amenities will be closed and restaurant will operate based on how many guests the hotel has. We decided to take our business elsewhere next time. Such a shame.",Valid,The review is clearly describing a personal experience with the service at Ace Hardware Store.

Metropolis Coffee Company,"The coffee's good, the staff are polite and the place itself is nice, but one thing I'm not crazy about is the new, somewhat pressured tipping system in which if you use your credit/debit card to pay, a monitor shows a series of tipping buttons that you have to choose from (and which everyone in line can see): $1, $2, $3 and then under that, a really obnoxiously big button that reads ""NO TIP"" which makes you feel like a cheapskate (which I'm not) if you're on a very strict budget for whatever reasons and just want to treat yourself to the occasional cup of take-out coffee.

Also, I wish they'd set up their outdoor tables and chairs even if the autumn weather starts getting chilly. Personally, I love the autumn chill and would prefer to sit outside.

EDIT: Since writing this review I was informed that Metropolis employees don't see whether you tip them anything or not while using the electronic payment method mentioned above. Due to this information I've raised my number of stars from 3 to 4. Also, I've gotten to know one of the employees, David Packer, a bit and he's a really great guy.

They take an extra step of charring the meat before they serve it (in a bowl as a stew or as tacos) which to me raises it to a whole other place.

Village Crossing,"Village Crossing is at the crossroads between Niles and Skokie, and simultaneously at the junction between convenient and nightmarish.

The store selection is varied, with standout gems like Gourmet Pita and Dear Frank's nestled in between big box stores starved for business. All of the smaller shops seem to be suffering this starvation more so than the big retailers who have corporate interests willing to foot the bill for what one can be sure are ever skyrocketing lease prices. A premium paid to be on the vaunted Touhy avenue to ultimately no benefit.

Several stores have been choked out already, quirky shops like U-Spy and Disc Replay, and even the UPS location that was here. Let behind are empty stores and fewer reasons to be anywhere near a Best Buy.

Defying all logic, there seems to perpetually be a furniture outlet on the verge of foreclosure in the back lot.

The lot is unnavigable at best, funneling traffic into nightmarish, grizzly, contorted lanes dotted with pointless stop signs and suicidal pedestrians.

Recent additions include a Tilted Kilt that no one wanted and Another Sub Shop. There's also a Tilly's for some reason. No one knows what happens in Tuesday Morning. And the Radio Shack disappeared before the bankrupt chain could even run a clearance sale.

An AMC happens to be hidden somewhere in this monstrosity, bouying and validating all of the attached stores through a somewhat parasitic relationship.

There's a decent Red Robin here, and a relatively nice Barnes and Noble.

I can say the same for entrees, southern chicken strips which came with no sauces even though the menu said it came with 2 and pulled pork Mac and cheese which came with barely any puked pork on it. On top of the horrible food, the cocktail I ordered came well after the food after I had to remind someone. We then waited 10 minutes for our server to show up after posting the button to order refills. And another 10 before we got our new drinks. I could've just gotten pur drinks myself in that time. The food is over priced especially if you only have enough time to have your $5 drink refilled one time. At 11 AM on a Saturday, you guys are not so busy that it's okay to ignore your guests. On top of all this, Insidious 4 is awful. I wanted to speak with a manager but after waiting 10 minutes for them to come talk to us, we just left. I feel as though we should not have been held financially responsible for the bill of food we didn't eat, a drink that was forgotten, and a movie that we hated. Which is saying something because we have always loved the Insidious series. Maybe the atmosphere set the tone for the movie? Idk. The only enjoyable part was the seating. We will be sticking to Studio Movie Grill after this morning's experience.",Valid,"The review describes a genuine dining experience at the location, and the 5-star rating is consistent with the positive text.",,,

Papa Saverio's Pizzeria,"I would give 0 stars if it was possible! We had a horrible experience with Papa Saverio's tonight! We go here often... so we are very disappointed!! My husband got there to pick up our pizza and they said it got stuck in the oven and was all messed up. They showed it to him and it was a complete mess! They offered a small discount or to make a new one. He asked them to make a new one because it didn't even resemble a pizza and would have been hard to eat. So they did and said they would remake a small that was fine, but would be cold. But when he asked to remake the appetizers (including fried foods) they refused! He had to wait another 15 minutes for the pizzas to be done...and they were sitting out on the counter the whole time! Then they only offered an even  smaller discount for all of this! He walked out without anything! Unbelievable that this was the level of customer service that they offer. We won't be going back!

In response to the owner's reply... the only reason it was nearly $100 worth of food was because you had to remake it. If we had felt valued and you had offered or even accepted my husband's request to remake the appetizer,  we would have taken the food.  It had been sitting on the counter for over 30 minutes when you called to say the new pizzas were ready! That is ridiculous and we will not pay for food that is cold and been sitting out, not even in a warmer! Then you call at 8 pm...2 hours after we were to pick up the original pizzas... to ask us to come pick up the food and to pay for it! That is so rude and unacceptable! We have been places where something has been wrong with a meal or a pizza and they comp the item for the inconvenience and the extended wait!  I'm not saying you should have comped the whole thing,  but you could have offered more than a 15% discount with over an hour wait from when the order was placed and cold appetizers!  I have posted this here and on Facebook and I will continue to post it on other sites!

The seats are six across with big letters to denote the rows.  There are six seats in each row.  Rows are kind of close to each other...you can't walk pass folks in comfortably.

The performance we went to see was A Love Affair by Jerry Mayer.  It was an interesting play about a 38 year marriage, funny and serious, with two sets of actors playing the older and younger version of the couple.  The actors and actresses were very good, drawing me into the story.  Not sure if all of the performances are this good, but I would be willing to go back here to see another performance.  It was nice to see a live performance with bubbles and not spend an arm and a leg.  Adult Tickets are $35 and Student Tickets are $20.

COCO NAIL BAR- ALGONQUIN,Oh My Goodness it's about time I walked out of a nail salon completely satisfied. To me its about 2 things. 1st is the quality of the work and 2nd is customer service.  I have been to at least 20 different nail salons over the last 5 years. None of them ever made me 100% happy and I always give a place 3 tries before I move on. It got to the point where I would dread going to get my nails done. And mind you I was just getting a mani with gel polish how to you screw that up? Trust me it happens.  Lol Finally I found a place that I walked into not 100% sure about it to walking out looking forward till the next time. The customer service was awesome.  The guy I had doing my nails was making jokes and actually made me feel comfortable. So was comfortable I actually got a full set something I haven't done in a long time. Quality of work was amazing and 100% happy with it. No complaints at all. And the best part their prices are very reasonable.  Totally not over charging like some places I have been too. So if your looking for a nail place I would definitely give the a shot.,Valid,"The review expresses a genuine positive experience at the store and aligns with the 5-star rating, related to the bookstore and customer service.",,,

The meal was exceptionally horrible I sat through it only cause I paid 9.24 for it and forcibly ate it. I should have gone one block down and had a macd quarter pounder deluxe which just came out.

We got the Chicken Tikka Pizza and the Chicken Fried Rice. The pizza was really good, the dough tasted like it was made from scratch. The Chicken Tikka was a nice twist, I don't think I've ever seen that before. My wife and I both really enjoyed it.

The Chicken Fried Rice wasn't bad by any means, I think they just need to tweak the recipe a bit. I think it was a little heavy on the pepper. I don't know if Pakistani fried rice is supposed to be different from Chinese/Japanese fried rice, but it didn't quite taste like the fried rice that I expected. But they did include soy sauce packets which made it better.

The owner was also super friendly, they had really good customer service.

I then waited for 20 minutes. When it was finally my turn to be helped, they told me that wasn't something that they could do in the store, gave me a flyer and sent me on my way. So I waited 20 minutes to be given a flyer. I was a bit irked that they knew why I was there when I checked in, and then made we wait. They could have just given me the flyer and sent me on my way right when I walked in, instead of wasting 20 minutes of my time. Not the first bad experience I've had there.

Village CycleSport,"I went to Village CycleSport in Barrington a few days ago looking for new bike as I have had them put together a couple of bikes in the past, and they did a great job.  The salesperson, upon my last visit, was very accommodating and nice.  I called a day later to say that my father had given me one of his older, yet very expensive, bikes - so, I was going to buy a new one for my wife and have the old one fixed.  They told me to come in - I said I would come in around 11:30 AM on Sunday - the service person said ""sure.""  I went in today and was told to wait - no problem.  But then, we were passed over three times for help so that new customers who came in could be addressed.  After waiting for 25 minutes, watching three different workers ignore us even after telling us to originally wait caused me to leave.  We live local and wanted to shop locally.  However, the customer service in this shop doesn't represent our neighborhood.  I will never return or recommend as customer service is everything.",Invalid Input,"I'm sorry, but I cannot complete this task without the actual input JSON data.

David's Bridal,"11/11/18 We walked in w an appt and I felt very nervous. I'm a thick bride and as soon as Colleen greeted our group, she saw that I was nervous. She was SO pleasant and fun to work with! Never asked my size but brought dresses in that were my size!!! They didn't have a dress that I pictured but she found the perfect dresses for me and my body type. I turned my nose up tot je first one and ended up falling in love with it!!! I tried on 5 total and walked out with the first dress!!! I am beyond excited about my experience and dress. I can not wait to walk down the aisle!!!!
11/24 Went back a few weeks later and got bridesmaid dresses. We were left to our devices until the girls needed measurements done. The store was crazy busy. All the girls found their dresses.
12/05 I set an appt to bring my mom.in to see the dress I chose. It was a great experience with Colleen,  again! At that time we chose a flower girl dress but didnt purchase.
01/06/19 Went in to try on the flower girl dresses with my daughter. She tried 2 on and she was so adorable. We chose the best one and had a very enjoyable time with the staff and alterations. I also picked up.my wedding gown at that appt. It arrived 4 weeks earlier than expected!
01/20 Flower girl dress arrived in only 2 weeks!!! The staff was amazing!
01/26 One of the bridesmaids dresses arrived. I went in and grabbed it. Was a quick and painless transaction.
02/05 The Moms and grandma went shopping. They each pulled 3 dresses and every one of them fell in love with the 1st one they tried on!! Put in the order for another size to come from a different store. Got alterations completed on another dress and the 3rd one was a perfect fit!! While I was there,  I picked up the other 2 bridesmaid dresses, was told the 4th dress had arrived at the other location needed for that bridesmaid and we set alterations appts for all the girls needing them! Again, all the staff was so helpful, courteous and timely!
03/07 Gtandma got her outfit back and the pants hemline needed adjustments. We waited 20 minutes and the hem was done!
03/10 Bridesmaids went in for their alterations and it went great. The gems and adjustments looked great!
04/31 I, the Bride, had my first alterations appt. I was so excited! We decided to do only the top adjustments and save the hem and bustle for my next appt so with the top fitting correctly, the hem would be more accurate. Weve been dealing with Alyssa and Sylvia.

BUD'S GRANDGEORGE CITGO,"The in store food is pretty awful here.  The premium gasoline contains ethanol which is a big problem for modern Stihl carburetors.  The labeling is deceptive on the gas pumps and I had to ask an employee if the premium gasoline contained ethanol.  This shouldn't be such a confusing process and can lead to equipment damage or problems with long term storage for vehicles.  Also, the gas pumps have little televisions on them and instead of showing the news or the weather, they bombard you with right wing messages and religious themed broadcasts.  I don't necessarily have a problem with conservative ideology or religion in general, but if I want that kind of information, I will go to a church or watch a conservative news program.  I certainly don't like having to deal with this stuff while I am pumping my gas.  With regards to the food, Bud's tries to emulate the type of food one would find at a Casey's but they do it very poorly.  The hot dogs are disgusting (compared to other gas station hot dogs), the baked goods are either improperly stored or available for sale too long.  The muffins and donuts are almost always stale. Actually, I can say that they are always stale as I have never had a fresh muffin or donut from this place and I have been here pretty early in the morning.  The general cleanliness of the store terrifies me so I will never eat their chicken or pizza (which appears to be frozen pizza just heated up and put in a warmer).  I have seen employees touching their face or hair and then go right back to food preparation.  So, to summarize, premium gasoline costs premium prices, but does have ethanol in it, so gas bad.  Food that should have been thrown away or sold as 'day old' is in the displays as fresh.  Pumping gas can be irritating.  I don't mind news.  I don't mind conservative news, but I don't want to listen to idiot pundits shouting at each other about topical events while I am pumping my gas.  I love our country, but the 'patriotic' pump broadcasts are jingoistic and can be called nothing else except propaganda.  Also, while spending 50 bucks on gas, I don't want to listen to a evangelist wearing six pounds of gold jewelry asking me to donate to their church.  If you want a quick primer on the major failing points of our country go ahead and pump some gas here.  I cannot stress enough that I love my country, however, I love it enough to be disgusted by the broadcasts from the pumping station televisions.  I have been here multiple times when I needed 93 octane gasoline, probably about 30 before I learned that the premium gas here contains ethanol.  The baked goods were never fresh or even remotely good and I was constantly bombarded by religious and jingoistic propaganda.  It is horribly ironic that most of our current military involvement concerns oil in one way or another and this gas station bombards you with pro-war sentiments while you are pumping your gas.  Also, I have no problem with religion, but I do have a problem with evangelists that preach the only way to salvation is by giving them enough money so they can keep their swimming pools heated.  I have never been to a gas station in North Korea, but I have a feeling that with a few minor adjustments the programming on the pump televisions would work just as well there.  I have not been back since I found out that their premium gasoline contains ethanol.",Valid,"The review shares a genuine experience related to the business, with specific mention of the location being 'beautiful' which can plausibly describe the museum, and the 5-star rating aligns with the positive sentiment.",,,

But after driving here to see i cant even get my check cashed at 9 and through the past experience of slow lines or slight rudness i just give up overall. Your employess were really nice to me telling me hrs are changed so i do honer that and want to say they deserve a raise to be in that department.im Try to work on the customer service a lil.

Illinois Harley-Davidson,"I always wonder about that high-1 star rating for this place! I hate writing long stories but I see I don't have a choice here today so...
I got a taste of it today! Some people in the reviews described it as doing them a favor I call it selling a name! I visited here to replace a pair of gloves that were stolen from the trunk of my bike that I borrow from one of my friend. Come to find I don't think they make them anymore. What's that wasn't the problem the lady was very pleasant and very helpful! It wasn't until I mingled with the sales staff! I am a hearing impaired individual since I'm very good at lip reading I do not have to usually tell anybody they need to speak up unless they have broken English! So today I walked around looking at the newer model Harleys thinking about doing a line to line comparison to the Indians! Since I know one or the other will be Direction I go next year when my warranty runs out on my present motorcycle. So I had a Salesman eventually walk up to me after wandering around for about 15 minutes and I asked him about a 2017 FLHXS because I've never seen this flat black before and it caught my attention! He explained a little bit and then went into salesman tactic mode... which annoying me I hate tactic users! Money!! So at that point I decided to tell the truth to him why I was very hesitant about buying Harley after the three I previously owned prematurely failed which cost me a deal of money and selling them for a loss in the end... I did this to annoy him intentionally I will not lie because I wanted him to back out of the you're buying a name thing he was pulling on me.. that and when he asked me if my friend who all riding on Harley asked me to park my bike away from them with his little story why afterwards on why..Like I should be ashamed of what I'm riding right now!!! As well to put him back on track to explaining how the new Milwaukee eight was better than the previous design.... instead did something I didn't expect he excused himself to go talk to her another salesman was standing off to the side! """" I need to get away """" <I read from his lips as he spoke to him> and the two walk off talking! I interrupted them and ask for the make and the model so I can research more online! He handed me a card with the description on it!
If he would have been a good salesman he would have finished explaining how the engine was improved and pushed towards a test drive! In hopes the feel of the ride would  possibly win me over! Nope not one attempt was made!",Rant_Without_Visit,"The reviewer mentions 'never been' and 'heard horrible things', indicating they have not visited the location themselves.

Curaleaf IL Melrose Park,"Absolutely disgusted by this company/corporation.    They sent out a mass email for new stores opening and new products being available at their locations.   Specifically I went to the Westmont location.  If you go to the site you can place an order for pickup and nothing said anything about the place not being open.    I drove all the way to the location only to be told by a security guard that the facility is not open and is in negations with attorneys and the city.  Yet they still sent out mass advertisements and have menus up and available encouraging people to come.
Then I called the Melrose Park location to see if this product that is up on their menus and stated to be available is actually there.    Not surprisingly, its not available and I got no apologies from the person on the phone .

People, Stop buying from these massive corporations.   Do you ever wonder why prices never go down from 60$ an 1/8 of flower.    They certainly weren't that way before recreational became available .   Now its all large corporations that monopolize the industry and block out small craft growers, cultivators and dispensaries.  Pay to Play, the Illinois way

IKEA,"I prefer this location to the Schaumburg one. It definitely takes less time to get to Bolingbrook than it does to get to Schaumburg if you live in downtown Chicago.

I went shopping here to buy a PAX closet system. The most convenient way to customize your system and therefore order your specific parts is to use their in-store computer kiosk near the PAX display. There are only two kiosks, however, which is far too low for the amount of traffic that section of the store receives. Most of my time spent in the store was standing by the kiosk waiting for my turn to use the computer. The software itself is another issue and you will likely need to grab the attention of an employee if you are trying to navigate it for the first time.

Compared to other IKEAS i’ve visited, the area where you collect your order after it was been filled is very unresolved. The waiting area is merged with the circulation area; the result is having to navigate your extra long dolly cart through throngs of people to the loading zone.

When I finally mentioned it, I was given an apology and promised extra chicken since I was waiting so long.   (Never received it.)  All the time I waited the employees were laughing and joking.  I wasn't the only customer who was treated badly.  A gentleman was waiting in the drive thru and ended up coming in to complain.

Well the local place I order from New China Summit was closed until further notice. So I thought I order from this 4 star place. Apparently the 4 star chef left after I placed my order.. Because this is by far the worst food I have ever had. I ordered shrimp fried rice and the shrimps were so tiny you would have to literally use a microscope to find them. And the shrimp with garlic sauce was full of sauce and maybe 6 shrimps. Let’s not forget about the mushy egg rolls.. I swear I’m not a picky eater however after spending 26 for one person on this magnificent meal. I would have rather the dried Cheetos I had at home. What a waste... If your really hungry and can’t find food for miles then go for it. Otherwise it’s a pass!!!!

Super Fat Rice Mart,"CONCEPT: Love the combination of influences from Macau and Portugal (each dish says what region inspired the dish, or if it is a Fat Rice original). The diversity of flavors at this place is amazing...as my friend said you may think you know what you are getting when you order it but you will be surprised.

WAIT TIME: Came here last night with 2 friends and it was BUSY for a Tuesday night...even though we had a reservation, we still had to wait a few minutes, but nothing unreasonable.

AMBIANCE/SEATING: Not too big of a restaurant but most seating is at long wooden tables so you will be elbow to elbow with strangers. That said, it adds to the lively atmosphere...you get to check out what they are ordering (and maybe even let them influence your own ordering experience).

SERVICE: Both the hostess and the servers were friendly and professional. Our waitress was attentive but not overbearing, a perfect combination. Each time a dish was brought out (often by a different server), they describe the dish which just gets you excited to eat it!

FOOD: As I talked about in the CONCEPT section, the flavors here are so diverse and not stuff you will find anywhere else. The food is meant to share so we ordered a bunch of dishes. The menu did have ""November  2018"" at the top so it likely changes and you may not be able to find the below dishes in the future.

Fava Escabeche: Pickled fava beans which were a great pallate cleanser for the rest of the meal

Bacalhau de vovo: Salted cod spread over Portuguese bread...delicious! Reminded me of hummus.

Pork + Ginger Dumplings: Similar to dumplings you'll find elsewhere but with woodear mushrooms (yum!)

""Cereal"" Spaghetti Squash: Spaghetti Squash in a coconut milk broth topped with corn flakes. This was so good this had me saying that I would eat corn flakes in coconut milk as a snack...and now I'm craving that.

Raba Raba: Perhaps my favorite dish...stir-fried mixed greens in an amazing sauce...I wish I could make greens like this at home.

Lacassa: Rice noodle stir fry which reminded me of really good street food I found in Southeast Asia. Add some of the Diablo sauce on top for an extra kick!

Kari Kapitan: Spicy Chili Chicken with Chinese Bacon. We ordered rice just to let it soak in this sauce.

VALUE: Definitely on the pricier side for the portion size but I am happy to pay for a great meal.

OVERALL: Loved my meal here and would definitely come back (I hear they have a good brunch too!)",Irrelevant,"The short text 'Not good' does not provide specific details about the service or experience at 'Sunny's Bike Rental', and is too vague to determine relevance.

In any case, the twice-baked potato, asparagus, and creamy spinach were just okay.  We were hosting some relatives, or else I would have chosen some other sides.  As for the steaks, everyone seemed to enjoy their cuts, but at least a couple of them were overcooked.  My filet wasn't nearly as tasty as some of the other steaks I've had around the city.

Pilot Pete's,"We live in Florida, but visit twice a year and have been wanting to visit this place during our travels since my son was born 2 years ago, it just hasn't worked out until now and now I'm sorry it didn't earlier. This place lives up to it's rave reviews and now I know why first hand. We visited on a Wed. night and the place was hopping for their fish fry that didn't disappoint either. Upon arrival, my son unfortunately had constipation (not to be so blunt) but the reason I mention it is because our server was absolutely devoted to getting whatever my son needed to help his hurting tummy. She was so accommodating based on my unusual requests and delivered on every one of them and we had barely even sat down yet. We were seated in the back corner along the windows, but perfectly set in a quieter spot with 2 toddlers as to not create commotion with their ups and downs. We all ordered our beverages and food and she was very attentive and prompt. The food was absolutely delicious and the portions were amazing, my sister and I split two meals and we couldn't even finish one together. The fish fry might have been the best I've seen and they do it perfect from there being more fish than breading on each piece and the fish not being greasy inside, to the perfectly cooked fries and hush puppies, it was amazing. We also ordered the fish tacos which seemed to have the same fish and was everything we were hoping. My grandma ordered a Reuben that she said was very good and coming from a long history of being in the restaurant business, she was impressed. A gentleman stopped by, who seemed to be the manager or owner and was just extremely personable. He checked on how everything was going, including how my son was doing and then surprised both toddlers with their very own flight crew t-shirts. Of course they put them on immediately and thought they were so cool as they were describing everything they saw on the runway outside of the window. If you have kids, don't wait to go here, they will be in awe with all the things to see and the cool paper airplane like toy they give to the kids ""upon departure."" And while we didn't see any airplanes that night, we would head back in a heartbeat for the awesome atmosphere and staff, and delicious food!

Thumka Indian Restaurant & Banquet Hall,"The restaurant is decent. A humble Indian restaurant tucked in the vacant strip mall in Barrington Plaza.

The ""Naan"" bread is delicious, moist and hot. their ""Matter Paneer"" was great as well as their popular desert ""Gulab Jamun"". a ball cake dessert soaked in syrup. Again 3 stars because of how the Tandoori Chicken was served. They had a limited variety of Indian dishes compared to other Indian buffet and restaurants I experienced . They tried to do their version of Chinese Vegetarian fried rice with Basmati rice but it was a ""Meh"" as well as their version of Chinese Sesame seed coated Chicken"" LOL. I think they should stick with their ethnic dishes and not venture to Chinese cuisine if they are trying to do Fusion. I would say the same for Chinese restaurants trying to cook Indian cuisine.

Park Place Dental Group,"CONSUMER FRAUD WARNING!

Given the other reviews my experience might be a one off issue but it may point to a more serious problem.  Let me start off by saying the people we interacted with at the location were very friendly and the service was of good quality.

That being said, we received a mail advertisement for free teeth whitening from Park Place Dental Group with service for new patients.  That incentive, coupled with my wife losing her job at Vatterott and needing to use the benefits before the end of the year, lead us to seek service from Park Place Dental.  When receiving the annual cleaning, I was informed I needed a 4 quad descaling.  I made it very clear at the time that given the benefits were expiring and that this is non emergency service, the quote must be accurate; I was assured it was accurate.  We were quoted a payment of $555.00 out of pocket, which was paid in full, and insurance covered the remainder (50% plus some).  Services were rendered late ’18.

In April ’19, we received notification from Park Place Dental that the insurance provider (Aetna), did not cover the quoted expenses and we were to pay the additional unpaid balance of $565.  Upon further investigation with Aetna, they stated that they cover 50% of their listed supplier price of $108 per quad and Park Place Dental charged $265 per quad.

It was a cold slap in the face to find that I could have received the same service from another dentist and paid $123 less than what I had already paid with 0% insurance involvement; all for a “free” teeth whitening.  I was left in the position that Aetna stated that Park Place Dental, intentionally or unintentionally, misrepresented expenses and Park Place Dental stating Aetna misrepresented coverage to them.

I attempted to resolve this issue through Park Place Dental’s Office Manager Kelli.  However, in the end, Park Place Dental's position was to seek reimbursement from me for the additional $565 with the offer to set up a payment plan.  I made clear that if that was their position I would have to pursue this issue as consumer fraud and got 10 months of silence.

Recently, I have received another invoice for payment of the $565 so I am forced to pursue this issue as consumer fraud.  I have filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau, Illinois Attorney General and the American Dental Association.

I heavily caution any consumer considering doing business with Park Place Dental.",Irrelevant,"The review is unrelated to the location, lacks direct reference to experiences at this business, and seems more like self-promotion or parochial commentary.",,,

Two Girls and a Cupcake,"I work at the Kitchn Chicago and share space with some of the most highly regarded and creative bakers and chefs in the city. Let's say I know the difference between a gourmet cupcake and Betty Crocker.

Driving on the main road, Two Girls and a Cupcake is visually the most attention grabbing structure, as it is bright pink.
Utica is adorable. It looks like someone copied and pasted a picture perfect small town from an 80s movie. It's manicured and picturesque. Everyone smiles and waves.

Went in Sunday with my girlfriend and got 12 assorted cupcakes. While we felt a tad rushed, we ended up taking our time and nobody was rude. It just felt like someone had a long day.

First off, this place is spotless. The prep area is visible from where you order and while we were there, a younger female was piping a light frosting onto chocolate cupcakes.

The variety of cupcakes was solid and the 6 or so I ate were all drastically different and all were very tasty.

You can tell a lot of effort went into creating the recipes and the cupcakes are all prepared meticulously. Almost every cupcake had a filling in the center. Every cupcake was different and garnished beautifully.

Here were the ones that I recall:
Cake Batter - Dead on, a little heavy on the almond flavor (fine by me). Appears to be a yellow chiffon with cake batter frosting and a reservoir of frosting in the middle. Killer cupcake. I love the detail with the cake crumbs. As soft and light as an angel food cake. Frosting is the correct density, not like heavy store bought frosting at all.

Cherry Cheesecake - Ditto. Dead on. Yellow batter, rich dark cherry flavor, a cherry on top and a cherry in the center of the cupcake. Unmistakable cheesecake flavor. Another dead on cupcake.

Chocolate Cream Pie - Do I have to write this? It tastes exactly like a chocolate cream pie. Probably the least striking visually; topped with chocolate chips and frosting, very rich chocolate batter, not too sweet, not dry. Right on the money.

Coconut Cream Pie - OK, I'm seriously not writing this. Like someone shrunk a coconut pie. Killer.

At $34 a dozen, it may seem expensive, but gourmet cupcakes in Chicago (I'm assuming most travelers to Utica are Chicagoans)are right around this price range and make no mistake- these are gourmet. They may be the best cupcakes I've ever had, I just dont want to piss off my colleagues.

As far as customer service goes... *shrug*
Everything was fine. Not everyone has to kiss every square inch of your ass to get you to buy their stuff. Go by the crepe stand at the farmers market in Chicago and ask the French guy something stupid. I'll bet you you've never received a tongue lashing like that over a pancake before.

As far as closing early goes, gourmet places reserve the right to do so. Places do it all the time, especially small town bbq joints, where it's ""once we're out, we're out, see you tomorrow."" Nobody complains because they know bbq takes time and is expensive to throw away. Gourmet baked goods are no different. Try to understand people- it isn't just eggs, sugar and flour otherwise EVERYONE would be able to make them. And NO, you can't just hang on to them if they don't sell. Baked goods take a big hit in quality in just 24 hours, so if you're obsessive about quality, selling yesterday's cupcakes today isn't an option. It's a good business model for maintaining product quality.

Bottom line- Great gourmet cupcakes in a quaint small town. Don't expect to get your ass kissed. Expect to drop $40.

Just a word of advice to ownership. While I may be a laid back and understanding customer, most people want an experience. Try to remember this is people's one vacation day and because we're poor, we went hiking in Utica instead of Italy or something. Spending $40 on cupcakes is a big deal for a lot of us, you could be nicer about it. I KNOW your cupcakes aren't box mix, but a bad experience can convince someone otherwise, just read the reviews- I'm sure those crappy reviews made a dent in your $ seeing as I almost didn't come in after reading them.",Valid,The review shares a genuine experience specific to the location being reviewed.,,,

Scratch On Lake,"It’s an alright place... probably wouldn’t come here again besides drinks. l came last Saturday with my wife, I had the Three Little Pigs burger, my wife had the Pulled Pork Taco. I love spicy things, never had problems with Sriracha... that being said, the burger was lava hot... temperature-wise, even after not touching it for a good 10 minutes - it was that hot. They don’t customize the temperature of the burgers, because they claim that every burger is done medium-well, “by design” of course. You know, that popular, always custom “one size fits all” design that you see advertised everywhere. The fact that a place doesn’t customize the temperature on burgers should have raised a red flag, as if it’s “made from scratch” you should be able to customize the temperature. The only logical reason as to why a dish would be lava hot even after 10 minutes on your plate is... a microwave. Felt like Chernobyl went off in my mouth biting into that burger.

Parlor Pizza Bar West Loop,"I didn't get to attend and will never attend this restaurant due to them cancelling their Halloween event less than a week ahead of time due to ""safety concerns"" of having an open bar package during the world series. Really? This place is in west loop, 30 minutes from Wrigley, you might as well abandon the city if you are that afraid of the cubs winning. And even with open bar packages you have the right to refuse alcohol if someone is too intoxicated. I bought my tickets well in advance to get the early bird special for a Halloween event, I could have purchased tickets to any other event and got early bird specials, but I chose this one. With less than a week notice, all other events are either sold out or super expensive, which leaves me with no plans for Halloween. Oh and the restaurant is still going to be open, but chose to make it first come first serve for table reservations, which were all booked within the hour. This restaurant doesn't care about customer satisfaction or ""safety"", they just wanted to make more money instead of the capped Halloween event price.

I called and schedule an appointment for my 2 cats. Told the person I spoke with on the phone that  they may have an upper respiratory infection. When we got there, it took so long to be helped. Finally when we got to the front desk and I had to once again tell them my 2 cats may have an infection, they asked us to go wait outside with our cats in below 0 degrees weather. They said someone will come outside to come get us and put them in a room. Seriously? Why weren't we brought into a room right away. They knew were coming. They knew we had sick cats. Now they want us to wait outside in freezing weather with our sick cats? After waiting in the car for 10 minutes someone finally got us and put us in a room. More waiting... Oh guess what? The receptionist never told the doctor that there was someone waiting. Besides the Veterinarian, this place was horrible. After the vet saw my cats, they prescribed us to antibiotics. We waited outside with our cats again while they were filling the meds. Guess what? The front desk kept lying saying that it was being filled when it wasn't. One of the girls with half her head shaved off was completely horrible and such a nasty attitude. She was definitely not doing her job and didn't care about sick pets like she should when working at an animal hospital. Finally got my meds for my cats after waiting for another 15 minutes. We arrived home and guess what? The measured the medication incorrectly. Wow what a joke. I would never recommend anyone to go here.

Rosebud Prime,"I had a phenomenal dining experience at Rosebud Prime on Valentine's Day. The food was explosively flavorful, the wine was potently delicious, and the seating was perfect (we got to sit upstairs right by a beautiful display with perfect lighting). Best of all was the service provided by our server, Webster, whose table-side manner was truly exceptional. Webster's impressively extensive menu knowledge, his attentive, jovial personality, and his keen ability to recommend menu items that are different yet ideally suited to a newcomer's palate, are just a few of the traits that make him an outstanding server. It is not surprising that Webster was originally trained as a chef! (I suggest you ask to sit in his section when you go there!) In the same vein, everyone from the door host to other waitstaff who consistently came to check on how we were doing (not to mention the fabulous chefs) contributed to our phenomenal dining experience. (We had a little too much fun and my date left his bag at the venue, which was also handled with utmost efficiency and professionalism). Even after frequenting several of the best steak-houses in downtown Chicago and elsewhere, I would have to say that my Rosebud Prime dining experience was honestly the best I have had to date.",Valid,"The review positively describes the dining experience at the location, expressing appreciation for both the food and service.

Skokie Lagoons,The Botanical Gardens is a beautiful place to visit. If you get the chance pickleback more than once an annual pass is a great value.

Scratch Brewing Company,"Do yourself a favor and seek this place out. An idyllic setting in the woods makes for a great place to drink beer, and oh the beer. Brewing that takes place in a giant copper cauldron over an open fire. Strange concepts such as single tree beers where all the brewing liquor comes from birch sap rather than tap or well water are the tip of the iceberg, with most beers brewed with locally foraged ingredients.  Sounds weird, and while perhaps it is a bit, the results vary from quite good to delicious, an impressive accomplishment given the eclectic brewing inputs. Tasty bread and pizza made with a locally grown sourdough culture also used to ferment some of the sour beers. Interesting, pleasant, and friendly founding trio Marika, Ryan, and Aaron run the place, so make sure you say hello.",Valid,"The review describes a very positive experience with the food and service at the location, aligning with the 5-star rating.",,,

West Suburban Medical Center,"I'm 33 and never had chest pains before. I know my body. I'm also poor, have depression and anxiety. I came here to get my chest pain checked out. Once they found out I have depression and anxiety, they pretty much stop taking my complaint serious after that. They waited 4 hours to tell me my chest pain is anxiety related. It's like any physical problem I have can be blamed on my mental illnesses. Like I'm immortal and nothing physical can go wrong with me because I have depression? You shouldn't discriminate against someone because they have a mental illness. The nurse stuck electrodes on my chest and stomach walked to the computer, walked back, and removed the electrodes. Took her 1minute or less. Fastest EKG ever. It seemed like they pretended to run tests. Then waited hours hoping I'd leave. They want you to come in after things get worst and you're in a more detrimental situation. I don't make up stuff. I don't frequent emergency rooms. I don't do hospitals, so if I come to one, it's because there's a difference in my health. In 33 years I've never come to the emergency room with any complaints before. I don't understand their logic here.

Illinois Department of Human Services,"I helped a family member apply for snap benefits and everything went through just fine.
When it came time to do the telephone interview they scheduled it on a bad day for that family member. They had their phone with them the entire day and not a single call from the caseworker let alone anybody from DHS.  We have called numerous times to get answers and only once got somebody on the phone after getting a notice they were denied for missing their interview call that was never made. When we tried to explain that no call was made my family member was basically told it doesn't matter and and they have to file from scratch all over again.

This office is sloppy and lazy. This seems to happen a lot with them even when there isn't a covid-19 pandemic going on.

I say clean house and fire them all and hire new competent staff.  Do an investigation to find which employees are committing fraud and charge them with crimes and make them serve time in prison for abusing a position of power and also committing fraud on a government file and record system.",Irrelevant,"The review content is not provided.
