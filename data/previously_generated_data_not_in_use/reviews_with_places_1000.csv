Long post: I visited this place back when they first opened, and even though it was good, I wasn't impressed with the options given and with a picky husband it was hard to select. Husband and I decided to try it last night. I had learned that they changed their menu up. Let me just say this place was top notch. I already knew the atmosphere was nice and cozy, made you feel relaxed and comfortable. We walked in feeling like we were welcome and appreciated! We both opted for the pasta dishes, him the spaghetti and me the alfredo, both came with side salads and we chose an extra order of the garlic knots. This food y'all! Let me tell you! IT WAS AMAZING! I am Italian and can be picky about my pasta dishes. Both dishes were just full of flavor and substance! The Alfredo was creamy and just perfect! The noodles were cooked to perfection! They were not crunchy and they didn't just fall apart in your mouth. My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs, again the noodles cooked to perfection, and the sauce was great! The meatballs were huge and cooked all the way through. The portions were big, one could easily leave with leftovers. Not us though, way to good to stop eating it! I love that they had other finger food options if you just wanted a snack and a beer. Or you could do the pasta for a nice date night, like the husband and I chose.  I can not say enough about this place! The prices were reasonable especially for what we got, and the owner was so nice. I kinda stuck my foot in my mouth when i asked if he had been there since they opened because i didn't care for the menu before. He politely said yes he didn't have a choice since he was the owner. lol Oh my! oops! he then explained how much time and effort he has put into this establishment hiring a chef from culinary school and revamping the menu to meet needs and cut down waste. Ya'll!!! It was great! Thank you Local Kitchen & Ale for sticking it out.

102626030611362585119,Jennifer Pollard,1499833669927,1,We were dining out front and they cut the lights out on my family without warning.  They literally served our food to us knowing that we we're sitting out at the patios and put us out in the dark.  I would not have cared if we didn't have 5 little ones running around. But having small children running around like that we needed a lit parking lot. We even asked for them to turn them back on so that we could get our stuff together and they refused to do so. I understand that they may be young and they may not have kids and don't understand. But being an outside dining area This was a very poor choice of the person in charge! They could have been responsible for someone getting hurt!  We will not be returning to this location and I would not recommend it to anyone else.,,,0x88893fa9221d71d5:0xf0adf682b030fb41,150,Sonic Drive-In,"Sonic Drive-In, 64 Chelsea Pointe Drive, Chelsea, AL 35043","Fast-food burger & fries joint with an old-school feel, including retro drive-in service.",33.3505428,-86.6214895,"['Fast food restaurant', 'Chicken restaurant', 'Hamburger restaurant', 'Ice cream shop', 'Restaurant']",3.6,567,$,"[['Thursday', '9AM–8PM'], ['Friday', '9AM–10PM'], ['Saturday', '9AM–10PM'], ['Sunday', '9AM–8PM'], ['Monday', '9AM–8PM'], ['Tuesday', '9AM–8PM'], ['Wednesday', '9AM–8PM']]","{'Service options': ['Outdoor seating', 'Curbside pickup', 'Takeout'], 'Highlights': ['Fast service'], 'Popular for': ['Breakfast', 'Lunch', 'Dinner', 'Solo dining'], 'Offerings': ['Alcohol', 'Quick bite', 'Salad bar', 'Vegetarian options'], 'Dining options': ['Breakfast', 'Lunch', 'Dinner', 'Dessert'], 'Amenities': ['Good for kids'], 'Atmosphere': ['Casual'], 'Payments': ['Debit cards']}",Closed ⋅ Opens 9AM,"['0x88893f9c564c8c79:0x17d0cda10733adce', '0x88893fa9707bedf9:0xb0e27ca76181bd65', '0x88893faadd58a537:0x9851882c1ee9d7d9', '0x88893fa1319de28f:0x30044e47941b6db9', '0x8889166b0910fbb5:0xdef6e06fefd7e667']",https://www.google.com/maps/place//data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x88893fa9221d71d5:0xf0adf682b030fb41?authuser=-1&hl=en&gl

100343660961459282971,Bailey,1619215000907,4,"I was craving some veggie / hibachi fried rice today and wound up here to try their carry out.  I was definitely pleased with my experience!

Located in a large shopping center with Publix and Champy's, on what I'd consider the Huntsville/Madison cusp, this restaurant seems to do mostly takeout even in non-Covid times.  Looks like there was a table or two to sit at back in those times, but Asian House is carry out only for now, and the dining area is cordoned off by a large table.  Staff members also speak to you from behind a barrier.  The lady I spoke with was masked and wearing gloves at the time of my visit, so all in all great Covid precautions.

I placed my order over the phone as I was headed out of my house.  The man taking it repeated it back to me accurately, took my phone number, and told me it would be 10-15 minutes.  My food was ready when I arrived about 15 minutes later, so that was great!

The lady who bagged up my food and took my payment was so sweet and pleasant.  She double checked my order, thanked me for coming in, and wished me a nice afternoon.  She also made sure to ask if I needed any forks, napkins, etc with my meal.

I was very pleased and impressed with the price:  two regular sized entrees and an appetizer for $21!  There was more than enough food to fill us up.  It stayed warm and the fried stuff relatively crispy on the way home.

I had my aforementioned vegetable hibachi, boyfriend got sesame chicken, and we split the gyoza.  The gyoza is pan fried, with one side rather crispy and the other still that pleasing, slightly chewy texture.  It was noted as pork gyoza on the menu, and for once, I could actually taste the flavors of the meat!  Sometimes I feel like gyoza gets a sort of generic vegetable-y flavor, but this one didn't.  Soy dipping sauce was standard but tasty.

Boyfriend described his sesame chicken as ""standard sesame chicken, which is not a bad thing.""  I tasted it and would agree.  The chicken came in large pieces and it wasn't overly sauced.  I noticed the chicken pieces seemed to be all white meat, which I prefer.  My veggie hibachi was really good!  It had broccoli, squash, mushrooms, peas, carrots, and onions.  Little heavy on the onions for me, but I picked around the excess.  Veggies were cooked well.  The shining star of both of our meals was the fried rice -- it was delicious!  Had that lovely slightly smoky quality to it that comes with the perfect balance of soy sauce and sesame oil.  Whatever you get, make sure it comes with fried rice!  My only regret is not asking for a little bit more yum yum sauce to pour on top.

If fast, tasty, affordable takeout served by friendly folks is your objective, Asian House delivers!","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYMvnVZdehvVJbaxVSPirPv2rfig9K6TG3Sd7S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKzIMV0s7xhNDKqVa9LI0astulQh16aEyENwBN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZTa7_2VWNidlqNgRPt1hFaSlkKLpg666JVJSG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",,0x88626f0c0b5084e9:0x6cede5463e3aba08,498,Asian House,"Asian House, 8000 Madison Blvd, Madison, AL 35758",,34.6917536,-86.71759879999999,"['Asian restaurant', 'Chinese restaurant', 'Restaurant']",4.4,155,$,"[['Saturday', '10:30AM–10PM'], ['Sunday', '11AM–9PM'], ['Monday', 'Closed'], ['Tuesday', '10:30AM–9:30PM'], ['Wednesday', '10:30AM–9:30PM'], ['Thursday', '10:30AM–9:30PM'], ['Friday', '10:30AM–10PM']]","{'Service options': ['Delivery', 'Takeout'], 'Highlights': ['Fast service'], 'Popular for': ['Lunch', 'Dinner', 'Solo dining'], 'Accessibility': ['Wheelchair accessible entrance'], 'Offerings': ['Comfort food', 'Healthy options', 'Quick bite', 'Small plates', 'Vegetarian options'], 'Amenities': ['Good for kids'], 'Atmosphere': ['Casual']}",Closed ⋅ Opens 10:30AM,"['0x88626616f17e042b:0xee251729e44d403a', '0x88626f80fe4ee761:0xe09b111c29991022', '0x8862658ac511925b:0x367dc0edf1c854cd', '0x88626618a7d8442d:0xb2ab7d0bfc7e3aa1', '0x88626570bd04f8c1:0x704d15f93b290f76']",https://www.google.com/maps/place//data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x88626f0c0b5084e9:0x6cede5463e3aba08?authuser=-1&hl=en&gl=us

I have one kid in the mini group (3-4) and they have very kind and patient coaches. They focus a lot not just on the physical aspects, but focus and listening as well. My son is always beat after his classes.

I have another kid in the littles (5-6) and she loves it. She adores coach missy. She is pushed a bit more physically, and also learns a lot about focus and following instructions.

My last kid is 13 and in the 'kid' group. She now has a physical outlet for some of her teen amgst and has really had a boost in her self confidence. She's pushed physically, but not to the point of dreading it (if that makes sense).

Prior to moving I was told by a AT&T customer service that since the building is already wired for AT&T, all I needed to do was take my router with me and plug it in at my new apartment. I double checked, “are you sure?”, to which I was again assured that it was just that simple. Several days later I move and plug the router in. No internet. I call AT&T and tell them what happened, and they scheduled a technician to come to my apartment several days later (Tuesday) to activate my service. It’s Tuesday night now, so I call and ask when I can expect to see the tech. After a long process of being put on hold and transferred to a “manager”, I’m told that I didn’t actually have an appointment. Even worse, they told me that it would be THREE WEEKS until they’d be able to get someone out to my apartment. I live in downtown Birmingham, a relatively big city, and they don’t have a single tech that can spend 20 minutes activating my internet service. Are you kidding me AT&T? What if I worked from home, or if I had a kid who was learning remotely? What if I caught covid and couldn’t leave for 2 weeks but still had to work? I literally have no other options besides using AT&T and they know this. I was misled multiple times by their representatives, then told to wait for nearly a month for a service I ALREADY PAY FOR. I’ve never posted any sort of product or service complaint, but this is the worst experience I’ve had as a customer. I really hope people see this and think twice before they switch to AT&T.

From a inexpensive shark to a top of the line Riccar upright, all the vacuums are on display for you to trial. That being said the staff of A & A Vacuum Mart is there to help you purchase a vacuum that meets your needs and budget!

We went in looking to buy something with a little more oomph and capacity than out handheld Dyson. Stephen Lord was very welcoming as soon as we walked in the door. We explained out needs and Stephen immediately started showing us vacuums that would meet our needs.
We then were able to test vacuums head to head in the showroom to see just how they would perform and why each one was better than the other, not something you could do in a department store. After the tests it was clear why the Riccar was our choice.

Stephen and David Lord were both on hand to answer any of our questions and demonstrate any of the products in the store.

114357665166539195229,Cyto Wing,1603762590577,5,"Overall this place was great. I am a jazz fan and was pleasantly surprised when I walked in and heard John Coltrane playing in the background. If you don't care for jazz don't worry, it is just background music.
The food was awesome, I had the grilled tuna and my wife the grilled salmon. Both were delicious and the sides were also.
They also have an excellent local craft beer selection on tap.
The staff were friendly and very knowledgeable, pleasant to be around.
This is a real restaurant, not fast food, not too slow either. I see a few people complaining that the service was slow. My response to them is that good food has to be prepared, not pulled from a freezer and put in an oven or deep fryer. If you go to a restaurant that serves these types of meals quickly then you can be assured that it was frozen and just re-heated. True dining is an experience to be savored and enjoyed, not rushed.
