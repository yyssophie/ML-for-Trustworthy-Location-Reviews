Upon ordering the pizza, I was made aware of their bizarre policy regarding pizza toppings. Apparently, half one topping and half another qualifies as a two topping pizza. So, my three topping pizza turned into a six topping pizza price wise. Let's just say, we couldn't make a deal. Needless to say, I wasn't surprised to see, much of the crew was outside on a break at 5:30pm instead of having pizzas to make when I drove back to the hotel from picking up supper elsewhere.

HuHot Mongolian Grill,"I will say my husband loves this place because you mix your own stir fry and he can make it as spicy as he wants. And the service was great. But if it wasn't for that, I would rate it lower because it was very dirty: multiple food containers were empty and every raw food container had food from the others mixed in. In addition, the fry cooks just scrape their spatulas on the edge of the grill after mixing each order—there was fried gunk and bits of food everywhere. I was very concerned about contamination (especially with the flash-fry method that may not cook everything completely).
In the sauce area, the plastic shield does not allow enough room to tip the ladles into your bowl, so sauce is spilled everywhere, including into the original sauce containers.
So, if your goal is making your own food and you don't care about cross-contamination, you will probably like it.

Ranchman's 23 Saloon and Steakhouse,"We arrived around 1130. We ordered 2 appetizers ( mozz sticks and spin dip). The apps were good the spin dip came with some soft garlic bread which was good.

We ordered steak with grilled shrimp and eggs with biscuits and gravy with a side of fruit. The fruit came out extremely early (before our apps were finished) and was clearly over ripe and had gone bad. The fruit had hit a fizzy sour phase. The gravy on the biscuits and gravy is canned or just a poor rendition of what sausage gravy should be.  The steak supposed to be med rare came out med well. The shrimp was over cooked to the point of chewy.

Prime rib sandwich with chips, onion rings, garlic mash and with 2 eggs and toast. The potatoes were a boiled potato that had no flavor. The chips were hit and miss raw and flavorless with some full on burnt. The eggs and toast never came.

Biscuits and gravy, eggs and sausage links. The eggs were supposed to be over easy but they were almost over hard. The sausage links never came.

Our empty appetizer plates sat on the table for quite a time. They were not busy. Our drinks often sat empty. Our waitress had a poor attitude and often responded as though we were troublesome for asking for our missing food ( eggs, sausage links and toast). She also slammed our plates onto the table when she was delivering food. We asked twice for our check before we got it. I had to ask twice and argue with the waitress over our check being incorrect as they were still charging us for the food we never received and the fruit which I told her twice that was bad. I ended up having to open a dispute with my banking institution.

The final thought the food was poorly made, over cooked and outright over its good date on some. The service was lackluster and poor. The price given all of these short comings is appallingly high. Our bill was also incorrect and when pointed out I was told that no it was fine it was just out of order.  I wouldn’t recommend stopping in for some food. There is a small diner about 15 minutes down the road that is cheaper with better service.

I started off with the ""spicy potatoes"" and some craw fish.   The spicy potatoes were absolutely the worst thing I've ever had in any restaurant all of my life.   Not fit for human consumption whatsoever.   The craw fish were lukewarm and unimpressive.   I then had some hot and sour soup.   The okra they put in it ruined the taste for me.. It didn't taste like hot and sour soup,  it tasted like okra soup.    I then had some angel hair Asian noodles with peanut chicken and butter chicken.   The noodles were not fresh,  and crusty on the edges -  translation... Sitting out for hours.   The  chicken was alright but cooked very long ago.   I'll spare you the rest of the details but it was simply not fresh food.   They had given up on it long ago.   We complained to the anemic looking gentleman when we left and his excuse was ""well,  it is close to closing time"".   Hey pal,  don't feed people this garbage.   You're going to get someone sick.

Buffalo Wild Wings,"I waited a little while to write this review so I didn't absolutely flame them into a coma. For my order, I had a 25 pack of boneless wings. I was in a rush and quickly paid for them without double-checking the flavors in the bag. Neither of the two flavors were the two flavors that I had ordered. One was parmesan garlic, which kind of made me gag. I am not a fan of garlic, so take that with a grain of salt. The other flavor was some sort of dusted flavor. Who the hell even puts dusted on boneless wings? It just takes something that's dry as hell and makes it even more dry. After trying 1 dusted boneless wing and turning my mouth into the equivalent of the Mojave Desert, I decided that the meal was a wash and threw it away.

Taco John's,"I went to this location, as another location in town was opening late due to maintenance. We went through the drive through, ordered combos B1, B3, and the donuts and coffee, also a side of nacho cheese (for the potato oles if that wasn't common sense).  We pulled up to the window, and I didn't realize B3 came with soda, so I apologized and asked for coffee instead. She tells me the total which is $14 and some change. When we get our food, I drive off, but realize the bag is pretty light. So I have my daughter look in the bag and realize we only have the 2 burritos and donuts.
I decide to call and make sure that we were supposed to receive potato oles, to which the lady replies ""well if you would look at your receipt, it will tell you how it was rung up""  I didn't get a receipt, I didn't think I needed it. She did confirm that B1 and B3 should have come with oles, but the drive through attendant rung them up separate....
Ok so...can we come back to get the oles or will I have to pay more?  (Because $14 for 2 burritos, a cup of donuts, 2 coffees & an orange juice isn't expensive or anything)  She responds with ""Um, well, I guess you can get some for the inconvenience""

I won't be going back here.",Valid,"This is a detailed review describing a genuine visit to Taco John's.
