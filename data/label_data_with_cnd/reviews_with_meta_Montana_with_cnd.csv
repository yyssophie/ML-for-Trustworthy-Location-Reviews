This place is always booked out for at least a month, and we wanted a reservation within the week so ended up taking a 9PM spot.

The fondue was devine, and we ate all of it even though we had already eaten plenty of the complimentary bread.

We’ve gone elsewhere though where he is separated into an active play group with a lot of space... and he absolutely loves it.

Buffalo Wild Wings,"I had a good time at BWW and as i was sitting there i noticed three employees, two females and i one of the males, standing next to the in and out door by the bar talking, and it didn’t sound like it was professional talk. And they were speaking loud enough for the people at the bar and the people at the bar table to hear. Not very professional especially in a restaurant business. I do want to give a shout out to our server and one if the male employees there. Veronica is amazing especially with waiting tables. She remembered all of what we wanted, checked up on us frequently, refilled our drinks. Great work. And Reese, i saw him carrying towers of cups, i assume clean, and is bussing tables and sweeping the floors and carrying dishes to the back to be cleaned. Veronica and Reese are hard workers and i think they deserve a raise. I appreciate hard workers like that, i use to work in the restaurant industry and i know workers who work their butts off, instead of talking loudly in an attitude tone, or going over to front desk area to show a couple more employees something funny on their phone.

Western Cider,"Ample seating, friendly service, a large and always updating cider selection, and a family friendly atmosphere makes Western Cider a great spot to catch up with friends or pass a solitary afternoon with a good book.

The ciders themselves are extremely varied, so there's sure to be something for everyone. If it is your first time I recommend starting with a flight of six to dial into a cider you want to spend more time with. There will be some that aren't for you (I personally can't stand their hopped cider), but everything is well crafted and feels intentioned.

Be warned: Many of the ciders contain more alcohol than you can taste which makes it easy to overreach yourself. And if you are prone to binge drinking be aware that there's no serving limit to keep you in check.",Valid,"The review provides a detailed and genuine experience at Western Cider, describing specific aspects like seating, service, cider selection, atmosphere, and even helpful warnings about alcohol content.

Flippin' Family Fun,Not a good place to book your kids party🥳 very unorganized! They no longer do Pizza Hut or water bottles like websites says. Do not encourage you to come sign up before the party and have all people in party sign up. Jump time starts when your party starts doesn’t matter if wristbands are on or not. I had a lady enter every kid one by one on a tablet and it took her almost an hour to get everyone done honestly! She could have suggested to use the tablets on the wall! That would have made things go a lot faster or for instance calling after I paid the deposit and instead of telling me about paper plates they provide I wish she was would have told me about needing all family and jumpers to be signed up before arriving if they have never been here before. When I tried to give them tips just so others wouldn’t experience the what I did they became angry instead of understanding. It was 210$ for the party! One hour of jump time rest time we had to be in a room which was fine if we actually got close to hour of jump time. I never asked for a discount or anything just let them know how they should have let me know that when I put the deposit down or when they called. When I addressed the taller and older man he informed me that I was talking about his wife. Literally said no offense but that’s my wife! All I was asking for was common courtesy. Their work and home relationship should be kept separate so they aren’t rude to customers in incidents like this. He proceeded to argue with me the entire time about how it’s my fault they lost out on jumping time like it isn’t even a big deal and I thought the customer is always right! I never said I was not going to pay! I only way letting you know what you could do in the future to prevent another customer from becoming upset. This is why you dating co workers doesn’t work out and in this case they are married. I shouldn’t be at fault just because I offended his wife for making suggestions. I have experience in this type of stuff and I’m a mother who loves a perfect party! I do one every year and have yet to be disappointed. Bottom line is you just never have a male customer talk to a female that way it was embarrassing I felt like I was being scolded. At that point the lady didn’t come back into party room for the rest of the time or even spoke a word to us. They delivered the pizzas from their oven. Left us with no cups and pictures of water. I hosted my own party that’s for sure and could have got people to sign in a lot quicker! Thought it would be helpful to have a host but instead it made things go much slower than anticipated.,Valid,"This is a detailed review describing a genuine experience at a children's party venue.
