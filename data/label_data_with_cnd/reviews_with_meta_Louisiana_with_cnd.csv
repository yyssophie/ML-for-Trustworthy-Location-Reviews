Ray Brandt Toyota,I liked how the waiting area had refreshments.  I went here to get a key fob made for my car.  I waited from 2 pm until 7:30 pm.  They estimated it would take 2 hours to complete.  I called 3 times to check on the status of my vehicle .  When they finally called me back the guy on the phone told me that they succesfully programmed my key fob clicker.

I went to the dealership and I paid.  When I walked up to my car I tested it and it did not work.  So I went into the office at 7:45 as the staff was all leaving and told them it did not work.  Good thing I tested it before I left because I would have never known until I got home.  The service dept employee  told me that he would fix it in 4 days because I told him I would order the actuator for 25$ online and fix it somewhere else instead of buying it from them for 300$.

Shrimp Basket Baton Rouge,"This place doesn't deserve the 2 stars. But the waitress did a terrific job. She was completely honest and actually steered us away from things SHE wouldn't recommend.

Maybe, we ate here on the wrong night. But I was very dissatisfied with the flavor and the presentation of the food. My partner ordered a fish plate that barely had 3 pieces of fish and the ""new "" potatoes were hard and soaked in butter. My mahi mahi tacos were edible and so was the fried okra.

But the Boom Boom shrimp were a joke. The shrimp were obviously frozen and then partial battered before being fried. The couple next us had to send back the Cheese Grits because they were cold!

Me and my wife's ribs were hard and dry, the only thing that was right were the burger sliders, my parmesan spinach was very greasy and the cooks sauteed regular spinach and placed it on the bottom, and to then put the creamed spinach on top of it, our waitress was cool, she was honest and told us to go get our drinks from the bar because when she places the order no one gets their drinks because the tickets magically disappear, I believe her because I stood at the bar 20 minutes before I was acknowledged.  There were employees sitting on the floor playing on their phones instead of helping customers, just a horrible experience, would have given one star but our waitress was cool so I gave two.

Two Men and a Truck,"So torn.

On the one hand, the guy who came by afterwards and repaired some of the minor damage was great. On the other hand, the moving experience itself was horrible.

I had a 3 bed 1 bath house moving to a 3 bed 2 bath house. I had 2 bedroom sets, an office, a full living room, 15 boxes, 10 bags, and 3 appliances to move. The distance between locations was under 2 miles. We were quoted 4-5hrs.

The last moving company I hired did a move from baton rouge to Denham with the same contents in under 4hrs with travel time.

The two men that turned up dragged their feet every opportunity they could. They kept closing the truck wanting to move to the 2nd house when the 1st house still had contents to be moved. They kept taking on-the-clock breaks. They kept losing hardware for disassembled furniture.

I literally had to keep stating ""everything but the fridge and oven needs to be on the truck"" but they still failed to load up all of the soft materials, appliances, etc, on the first trip. They packed so stupidly they had to make 2 trips.

On the first trip, to the new location, they left the same time as me and somehow took an additional 15 minutes driving the 1 mile to the new house. They forgot the bed hardware at the old house. After unloading the truck, I had to send they put the furniture where I asked them to put it and not just drop it in the center of the room.

I then had to bribe them to make a 2nd trip to retrieve the 10 bags, 2 missed appliances, and a bunch of other small items. Again, I had to keep reminding them I'm paying for their time and I needed everything moved, everything. They kept closing the truck, again. They kept walking past items, stating rooms were empty when plastic crates and PCs were sitting in the middle of the floor. 6hrs after the move started, I finally managed to get nearly everything into the new house.

Of course, we went back and retrieved stuff like the dryer vent line, the microwave, two more boxes, and two baskets with electronics that were missed on both the first and second trip.

The manager who turned up 3 days after the move apologized for the men, and repaired some of the damages. He cut a check for $165 to offset damages to a coffee table that looked like the guys used as a dance floor.

Today, I finally had a reason to start looking at hanging my 55"" 4k Samsung TV. To my horror, I just found not one, but 3 decent scratches on the glass. Here's hoping 2 men and a truck can cover those damages too.u

Edit: damage guy hasn't returned 5 calls and check for damages never arrived.",Valid,"This is a detailed, genuine review describing a specific moving experience with Two Men and a Truck.

Akira Sushi Hibachi,"Hadn't been in almost 2 years so thought I'd give it the benefit of the doubt tonight. Kind of knew better in the back of my mind but went with the all you can eat for $21.95 special per person. The restaurant itself was a shi% show not that I'm one who normally really cares, but it was slam packed, understaffed and every single waitress couldn't speak a word of English other than the food that was going to be ordered- which normally wouldn't have been a problem either had the food been edible at all! Thank God they took off the price for one person at our 3 top, since she ate literally nothing.  Since it's all you can eat special they bring you the nastiest smallest portions of food they can find for example the beef teriyaki we ordered 3 thinking it would be nice little single portions maybe 2 oz of steak each, in this case to feed one person they give you 3 cut up pieces! Yep you read that right yes 3 to 4 PIECES of steak (LESS THAN .2 OZ)  that is red ,raw has blood on plate and cannot be chewed as it is all fat. 🤮🤮 The sushi I ordered was not what I wanted apparently snow crab roll is gone and everything else they had sushi wise looked very old and not appetizing at all. here I am at 8:30 making dinner at home after sitting there for one whole hour trying to get the hell out -I will never ever ever be back!",Valid,"This is a detailed review describing a genuine dining experience at the Japanese restaurant.

The Grand Lafayette,"Update: 4 years and another lazy, half-hearted remodel later, I still keep wishing this chain would just fold and be replaced by any other theater chain. Still the same cruddy screens and terrible sound. Now with reclining seats in maybe half the theaters! Yay.

Original review:
This location underwent a lackluster, half-hearted remodel (the chairs are nice, the colors are not) that failed to replace aged, stained and otherwise damaged screens. The audio in most of the theaters substitutes volume for a quality and fidelity that is sorely lacking. Following the remodel, the size of the popcorn containers was reduced considerably while the price was most decidedly not, and the quality seems to have declined as well (this coming from a movie theater popcorn junkie). The Grand 16 makes me wish for another chain to come to town every time I attend. Their monopoly on Lafayette cinema had allowed them to get away with a steady decline in every measure of quality and, frankly, I see far more movies for the first time on Vudu or Blu-ray now as a result.",Valid,"The review provides a detailed and genuine experience about visiting this movie theater location.
