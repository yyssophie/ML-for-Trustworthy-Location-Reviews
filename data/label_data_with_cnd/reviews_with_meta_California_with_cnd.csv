"Tonic Smoke Shop, Vape, CBD, Kratom, Puff Bars (Sacramento)","I live very close to this shop and drive by its location daily; because I noticed the sign on the building from Tonic, I thought to myself, ""That's a new sign and I think Tonic is a shisha brand. I'll stop in very soon and check it out!"" Stopping in is just what I did!

Upon entering, I noticed many hookahs and hookah accessories lining the wall on the left. Hookahs were set up in the middle of the store on tables and it seems as though you can smoke out of them. I didn't ask the guys working if that was what those particular ones were for because I seriously was more interested in finding a new shisha flavor to try out. I had a nice young man help me and I swear he looks just like the comedian Gabriel Iglesias! Anyways, he helped me and I smelled some recommended flavors. I ended up taking home 100g of Purple Mermaid to try out - if I really like it, next time I'll buy a 200g can. He was also nice enough to show me the Tonic brand hookahs that they have. I truly needed to buy a new hookah to replace my current one that has a rusted stem so I ended up buying a Tribes hookah for $35!!! That's right my friends, $35 for a nice sized hookah! The great thing is, Tonic hookahs come with a year warranty in case something happens to your hookah! Score! There are many more hookah accessories in a smaller room in the back of the store and they carry many brands of natural charcoals like Coco Nara and Coco Mazaya. I love this place so much as a hookah smoker and I've visited only once!

Hollywood Sign,"(Translated by Google) 2010-2016
Head west on Franklin Avenue from Griffith Observatory and head north on Beachwood Drive
After passing the beachwood market, take the alley to the left and continue climbing to reach this place.
Since there is not much space to stop the car, you will have to wait for a while if you are behind the customer.
If you go deeper than that, it will get in the way of the residents, so please refrain from doing so.
There is also a hiking trail that goes behind the sign, but if you like time and walking, that might be a good choice.
If you stand behind the letter H, you may be able to relive the pessimism of British actress Peg Entwistle, who committed suicide by throwing himself, which is one of the reasons why the letter LAND is removed from this sign.

Tanaka Farms,"I've gone here so many times with my family.

This year however was rediculious. Not that anyone cares but I live about 30 mins from here. We got the kids pumped, ready and in the car.
As we pull into the parking lot theres 1 sign saying we need to get our tickets online.

The place was NOT packed or full so obviously I go online to get our tickets. I couldnt for the life of me find where to buy these tickets. So we walked up to the entrance where maybe 20 people were standing and asked if I was even on the right sight.
Well apparently they were sold out. With about 100 people on the property.. (This whole place is outside incase anyone hasnt seen it and its a pretty big lot of land.)

If you went successfully. How did you know, beforehand, that you had to buy tickets? And how did you get them?

And there was zero indication on their websight that the tickets were sold out.

I was very pleased to find out that I wasn't on a contract anymore despite less than 24 months having elapsed between the day I ported the above mentioned number into Sprint and the day I ported out. I was also very pleased to discover that Sprint did not assume I wanted to continue service with a new number after the abovementioned number ported out of Sprint.
