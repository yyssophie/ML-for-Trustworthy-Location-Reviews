Valvoline Instant Oil Change,"Usually I will give 5 stars for this location and its crew. Im undecided as of now 😕.
We had an oil change, new air filter and a serpentine belt replacement suggested by associate. It has been a week roughly and have noticed something like the sound of a rattling bolt under the hood near the serpentine belt when in idle especially.
My car smelled like something was burning this morning and my 6 year old also relies on this car for transportation so I took my car back to have this resolved and move forward at least tighten down the rattle. Which did not have that sound or issue before. They took a look but were reluctant to get in there and tighten it down and mentioned to bring it back Thursday when a more experienced associate or the manager would be there.
Until then I am concerned to continue driving my car to and from work without anything done physically to correct it. We have been going here for years. Until this is corrected I will leave it as blank star and then gladly change it. I just hope nothing bad happens while we have to drive it.

Update ...Went back to see manager he went above and beyond to help correct or figure out why or what may be the problem. It appears to either be the HV clutch or a bearing. Next bet will be to see a mechanic. This location will continue to have our business and we trust their abilities, good judgment and hard work.",Valid,"This is a detailed review of a genuine customer experience at an oil change service.

Jefferson Mall,"I tried reaching out to mall management with a complaint about one of the kiosk vendors today but the form on their website isn't working and they don't have a contact email, so I'll put it here instead. Early today, while walking through this mall, I had an off-putting experience with one of the kiosk vendors that I felt I should make known to mall management. I was walking past the Deep Sea Cosmetic kiosk, when the vendor grabbed me by the hand, turned me around and placed a sample product into my hand. He did not ask me or even address me at any point before this. HE DIDN'T EVEN SPEAK TO ME BEFORE TOUCHING ME. He just grabbed me (while I was walking alone through the mall), put the loose product into my hand (despite my raising concerns about allergens because I have severe topical allergies to many products). He then steered me over to the kiosk. He offered to do a demonstration with the product and I declined. At this point, he directed me to put my hands over a bowl so he could remove the product he had put there. Once I was there, he proceeded with the demonstration anyway. He would not listen to my repeated refusal or my questions about allergies. After drying my hands off, he proceeded to ring me up for products that I had not asked for and had refused many times--MORE THAN $100 IN PRODUCT THAT I HAD OUTRIGHT REFUSES. I continued to refuse and--after attempting to persuade me by lowering the price--he then slammed the register closed and began to make rude comments about my clothes and appearance. The experience made me extremely uncomfortable, and I feel this goes beyond the line of just a pushy salesman. There is no reason that salesman should be grabbing women--by their hand or otherwise--as they are walking alone through the mall. I clearly refused the demonstration and the product MANY times (to the extent that a salesperson at another kiosk nearby ended up interceding and asking the man to leave me alone) but he persisted. My hands are now very irritated and sore. Fortunately, the reactions I have are normally only topical, but that may not have been the case for someone else.",Valid,"This is a detailed, genuine review describing a specific negative experience at Jefferson Mall involving a kiosk vendor.

"Fayette Heating & Air, A/C Repair, HVAC, UV Lights Lexington KY","I called for a technician to make my home cool again. The last week has been brutally hot. We got Someone to come to our house and tell us our AC system is just plain old. Having been with the company over 15 years, I trusted his assessment and took an estimate on a new system install. My house reaching temps over 80 degrees, as I scramble to put together $7000 for a new install, I began to get curious. Being mechanically inclined, I took a look at my system, wondering how something becomes “too old” to cool my house as it did the week before. Upon my inspections I found my Coil was frozen into a solid block.

They never took the time to look at this, I don’t know why, perhaps because he was too busy, or complaining about the heat, or perhaps because he’s so close to retirement he doesn’t feel the need to perform, or perhaps he gets some incentive to sell more installs, but nevertheless I was charged $80 for them to write me an estimate on an install I may or may not need, time will tell.

Comfort heating and air seems to have a much better service history, and their estimate was much better quality than the one provided to me.

I said that’s fine and he kept it moving. THEN THE RECOMMENDATIONS......There were 3, two of which he said can only be done at Volvo...Cool....but then he said that.... get this....my check engine light is recommending a power steering flush that they in fact CAN do there for me......... I immediately got offended considering that my VOLVO HAS ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING! His face was absolutely priceless when he learned that I knew this! Then when I got my total and the oil filter that he said was $3.99 was really $7.99 and I called him out on it.....do you think he offered to fix it or even own his mistake!? Nope he just justified it with the fact that oh ya know I drive one of those foreign cars! Nope I don’t know how the emblem on my car made you completely lie to me and attempt to take advantage!

Noah's Ark Animal Clinic of Ft. Wright,"Staff is very friendly and very helpful.

The kennel is great for my pup and the staff really love dogs and taking care of them.

The vet side is great as well and the staff are very good at their jobs but the wait times are horrible at the NKY location. Since there are no appointments you put yourself in a queue and wait until you’re 3rd to head into the location.

This can take over an hour if they’re busy. Once you’re there you can wait another hour until you’re even put in a room, and if they’re busy you could wait another 30-1 hour in the room. It’s a very painstaking process and to be honest I originally came to this clinic because I thought it was much more affordable and could deal with the wait times but they’ve gotten progressively worse which is unfortunate.",Valid,"The review provides a detailed, genuine experience about the animal clinic, discussing specific aspects like staff friendliness, kennel services, veterinary care, and wait times.

Malone's Lansdowne,My husband and I made reservations at the wrong Malones! We drove 2 hours so we assumed it was just as fantastic as the other malone restaurants and kept our reservation. Our crab cocktail was amazing as usual. The waiter was fast kind and efficient. The long island ice tea tasted like there was no alcohol in it so switched to water. We both ordered steaks medium rare. They both came pretty done. Unfortunately we had to send them back which we never do and both felt awkward about but the manager was very kind and took care of us. Although it was still a very pleasant evening for us we did have impeccable service and food at a different location and will probably choose the other malones in the future!,Valid,"The review describes a genuine dining experience at the restaurant, including specific details about food items (crab cocktail, steaks), service quality, and interaction with staff.
