"Motel 6 Nephi, UT","Note, my stay was not recent, so if management/ownership has changed, conditions might be different, but other reviews suggest it hasn't.  Possibly the worst hotel that I've stayed at.  We had to go back to the desk to ask for towels, soap, shampoo, etc.  We went to use the hot tub to find out that they turn it off to save money and told us it would be about 12 hours or so before it heated up above the 60 degrees that it currently was.  Staff was not helpful.  The bed was uncomfortable, and the hotel was surprisingly noisy (poor insulation and weatherstripping on doors).  I think it only exists to take advantage of truckers just looking for any cheap place to crash who roll in at midnight.  It sounded like someone was trying to fix a transmission in the room above us.  My wife and I stopped here when my 1 yr old daughter decided that the 8+ hours we had been driving was unacceptable.

Quick & Clean Car Wash,"Received coupon for one top of the line wash.
Could definately see the superior quality shine as compared to other car washes comparable offerings.
I like that the floor mat wash is included here! Quick and easy to use. Next time I will pretreat them and see if I can't get old stains out; they look so much nicer now. I suggest starting here so they can 🌞 while doing the other services. The woman stealing the vending machine nearby suggested that I use the vacuum to help speed up the drying process. Very pleased!
They have the air pressure sprayer for dusting and getting into deep crevices.
I have to press the start button on the vacuum too often duration is a bit short for me. Also the nozzle kept falling off the hose.
A young woman was filling the vending machine outside. Other than that I only sold one employee doing receiving of customers and pre scrubbing.  I arrived and was not sure what to do so I exited my car and went in the office. He saw me through the window that leads to the carwash and acknowledge me promptly.

Jake's Automotive,"This is a long review, I hope you stick through it because it may help you decide on what makes a great mechanic versus a crappy one!

I had an air conditioner issue in the middle of summer.  Troy answered my call, was polite and extremely knowledgeable.  He was open to my input as I described the issue I had and was even patient with me as I tried to tell him more and more.  After calling around and getting hung up on I decided to call Jake's automotive back.  Troy answered and told me about the drop off overnight availability that they had there.

When I brought my car in on Sunday night to leave it, the car lot was full.  It was a good sign to me, showing that they had a lot of work.

Troy called me later that day to tell me what was wrong with my air conditioner.  He found a hole that punctured one of my lines and described the labor that was going to be involved.  I approved the order and he fixed it same day.  The shop closes at 5:30pm and he called me at 5:28pm letting me know it was ready for pick-up.

This sounds like a normal fix'r upper doesn't it?  Well, there is a reason why I have gone into so much detail.  Because it wasn't fixed.  I went in on Monday early evening and picked it up.  The A/C was working, but by the time I got home it was not.  I immediately called back and Troy answered the phone, clearly after they had closed.  He said he was working on something else and asked me to bring it back in.  He discovered that the charge of Freon in the system was too much.  He did not give any excuses, he just stayed late for me to drain it out and re-charge the Freon.  It was clearly a mistake, but it cost him, not me and I deeply appreciated the extra effort to make it right.  He could have just not answered the phone when I called him.

LunchboxWax Park City,"I arrived a little early and so fully expected to have to wait but after filling out a short form, standard release of responsibility, Austin took me right back and we got started. The salon is very clean and well appointed, I was given a sanitary towelette and a modesty drape and given a moment of privacy.
Austin was quick and as gentle as possible. When booking I was led to believe that the appointment for legs and bikini would take an hour and 15 minutes but I was pleasantly surprised to be in and out in less than 40.
The salon used a soft wax for the bikini area which is different than what I've had before but didn't seen to be as hot or painful if memory serves. I do have a couple of stragglers but that is more likely due to my hair than anything else. The one thing that I would say stuck out to me that I didn't really enjoy was a little lapse of privacy. The room that I was in is set up such that the table faces the door which opens onto a bright windowed hall which could potentially lead to a little awkward exposure.

The food was delicious too.  We ordered the mango guacamole with chips and it was spicy, sweet, and fresh. The chips are killer. I ordered two turkey chorizo tacos that were flavorful and filled with just the right amount of contents--not messy!  My boyfriend got the mushroom tacos and grilled veggie tacos (vegetarian).

Bottom line is I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. It's okay if nothing else is convenient. But there isn't anything special about the food.

Thousand Lakes RV Park,"This is the best RV park we have ever been.

The owners of Thousland Lakes RV Park are extremely friendly and helpful. They greeted us at the first night of arrival which contributed to a beautiful start to our long weekend getaway. The park in general has a very thoughtful layout. A green field in the middle of the park is surrounded by cabins, the tent sites and the RV parking lots. It resembles a meeting point and it is easy to make friends there (especially kids can roam around and play under the sight of their parents eyes). The pool is right next to it.

We stayed in a normal cabin over that weekend. Each cabin has its own fire pit, chairs&table inside as well as outside. The beds were comfortable and we had a beautiful view out of our back window.

The RV Park is meticulously clean and very well maintained. Visitors and staff are friendly and respectful. It was quiet at night even though plenty of kids were present during our visit. The RV park is conveniently close the national park, restaurants and a general store.

We have heard from friends complaining about WIFI which we personally did not use during our stay. The RV park offers Jeep rentals, a hair salon and a cute gift shop. We usually don't shop at gift shops but we found some beautiful things there (including a Christmas gift). I can highly recommend to visit the gift shop just because of the decorations, clothing and jewelry they sell there.

One improvement we can think of is the check-in process. Upon arrival, we have not received any information how the check-in procedure works. A recommendation here is, to send an info sheet along the confirmation email and put office/check-in hours on the website. The day of arrival, we tried to get a hold of the receptionist to receive more information about our check-in as we knew we would arrive after 10pm. We haven't heard anything back from them that day, neither via email or phone. Once we arrived, the reception was closed as expected. We found the trailer with the camp host who wasn't present and nobody answered the phone. After a while of looking around we saw little post-its with check in information on the door of the reception, so we could unlock the cabin by ourselves.",Valid,"This is a comprehensive, genuine review of an RV park experience.

We wait a bit longer and I finally go up front and say to this young man. ""Did you forget our ice cream cones?"". He looked over at the table he had earlier taken ice cream cones to with a completely bewildered look on his face.  Clearly, he had taken our cones to the wrong table.

The Alloy at Geneva,"As a newer property, the Alloy is undergoing some growing pains--parking is scarce, the dog situation is kind of out of control, and the garbage problem (for us) has been difficult. I think the apartments are also grossly overpriced. However, maintenance is super on top of things when you call and management is responsive when you email or send them messages. If noise is a concern for you as it has been for us, perhaps an apartment away from the hubbub of everything would be better. We're right next to the clubhouse and the pool and the Alloy is BASICALLY student housing. So you're going to have noise from the pool and clubhouse at all hours of the night, and there's nothing you can do about it except rent a unit further away from where all the students gather to shirk adult responsibility. ;) It's really been a rough year but provided you read your lease carefully, realize what you're getting yourself into, and tack on an additional $200 to the rent they say you'll pay monthly, you'll probably like the Alloy.
