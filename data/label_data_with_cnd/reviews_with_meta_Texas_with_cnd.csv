Post Midtown Square,"You tore up our courtyard and removed the trees over a month ago. Do you ever plan on doing anything about this or just wanted to come and made our courtyard unusable and a construction zone..

I have packaging missing for over a month from the mail room. The package receiving systems is broken and they made no attempt to notify residents of this issue for weeks. Now I am missing Christmas packages I had no idea about until my friends and family asked me if I ever received them. I have been very patient with them trying to resolve the issue of the mail room...it was a 3rd party that ran it, but at this point, they have made such a pathetically small attempt to get people their personal mail that it is now beyond ridiculous. I can't get people on the phone to help and they dodge my questions about how to resolve this issue. If you want a nice location to live and that's it...great. But pray you don't have any issues that require the leasing office's help.

True Food Kitchen,"Didnt have the best take out experience today which is odd because I've been coming here since it opened and I love the food.  First off, I called and when the young lady answered she said she had to transfer me to the bar.  Not bad but I thought the bar phone rang when you called in.  She put me on hold, where I stayed for 5 minutes so I hung up, called back and she transfered me again and I put in my order.  When I got in to pick it up I saw a carry out bag sitting at the bar so I went to sit in front of it figuring it was mine.  The bar tender, a tall slender caucasian guy caught eye contact with me, walked around to the other side of the bar, poured some water, then walked back and was like ""Oh I didnt even hear you come in"".  As if the direct eye contact he gave me when I came in wasnt enough for him to know I was there, I was also wearing loud cowboy boots and it wasnt hardly anyone in the restaurant.  The only person who wouldnt have noticed me come in wouldve been someone blind and deaf.    Some other young ladies came over to the bar and he told them to check the order to make sure it was mine...  What was wrong with him making sure it was mine.  He was literally doing nothing.  I sensed it was some tense energy in there surrounding this guy because the other young ladies had frustrated looks on their faces.  I paid for my food and left and as I was walking away he loudly and sarcastically greated someone else.  I had my food at that point but did want to make sure I set aside time to write this review because whatever is going on with the guy at the bar today, tall slender caucasian guy, he seems to be rubbing everyone, including me, a paying customer, the wrong way.  The food is always good, I wouldve given 5 stars otherwise.  I'll make sure not to come in for a while so hopefully I'm not ""served/helped"" by that guy next time I come in.

This is definitely a quality over quantity issue though and I will certainly be back for the Pho and to see what else is on the menu!

Grand Lux Cafe,"I used to live in NY, and this restaurant quickly became an all time favorite. I then moved to Texas and a few years later found this location in Austin. I was so excited as I missed the incredible food, deserts, and service I experienced in NY. However I became quickly disappointed. The food was still decencompared to other restaurants and the service wasn't awful, compared to other restaurants. But neither are what I have known and come to expect from a Grand Lux. This place is rather pricey. It's one of those places you go to treat yourself or small family once in a very blue moon. However the quality of food and level of service were not worth the price from this experience. Myself, husband, and best friend went together as I wanted to bring them to the amazing restaurant I knew in NY. We were quickly seated. However the decor was outdated and felt as if we were sitting in one of those hotel restaurants where not much thought is given to decor because the restaurant is really there out of convenience. My friend and I ordered brunch drinks. The drinks themselves tasted decent but not $10-$11 dollars a glass decent and they were very very small. The bloody Mary was served in a rather small glass with tons of ice. Mine was served in a small champagne glass. Neither had any traceable amounts of alcohol in them... like I said, they were tasty, but not worth the gouged price. Our waiter quickly checked back in to see if we were ready to order. We ordered but that was the last we saw of him until the end of the meal. Three separate people delivered our food at different times. We were never prompted or asked about desert when our order was taken. This place makes several things to order and take roughly 30 minutes, so your waiter needs to put in the order at the beginning. Let me tell you, the desserts from Grand Lux are to die for, but we were never asked or able.to order them, so I can only speak from my experience at the NY location. My friend ordered the lunch omelet with a side salad. It came out with hash browns and no salad. The waitress delivering it quickly apologized and took it back for her. However another 15-20 minutes went by before it came back out. I shared my Asian tacos from the tapas menu while we waited. They were yummy. I also ordered mini crab cakes (my husband's favorite) and tuna ceviche but was told after the fact they were out of the ceviche. Which was okay ultimately, as I became full very quickly, but it would have been helpful if my waiter was aware of any menu changes in the beginning. My husband ordered butter garlic shrimp pasta. The sauce was good but the shrimp weren't cleaned properly. They had sand in them, were gritty, and not deveined. We finally saw our waiter again once we were finished. He offered to box our food up to go which we said yes. My tacos and crab cakes were both supposed to have sauce. At the NY restaurant I go to they always included an extra to go cup of whatever sauce your food came with. This waiter did not. The food was good but the sauce definitely doesn't all together as it should with any decent meal. Like I said, it would have been good if I were going to a restaurant like cheddars. However this is the Grand Lux. For our simple meal for three people (and my two very small plates coming from a tapas menu), our bill was well over $100. This is not the type of food or experience I would expect for the name or the price and I am highly disappointed. To add insult to injury the food made me, my friend and husband very sick that night. It was the only thing we ate all day and the only meal we have ever had in common in over a month. My friend lives in Austin and I live by Fort Hood. So there is no way and highly unlikely it camfrom something else we ate. I would highly doubt the possibility of me ever returning here. I guess I will have to wait on the rare trip if ever, I go back to NY to visit a Grand Lux again.",Valid,"This is a detailed, genuine review of a dining experience at Grand Lux Cafe.

Best Buy,"I am extremely frustrated with the Geek Squad service I have received.  I took my computer in on July 29.  I was told they would have to send the computer off to a service center for repairs, so I should come in to back it up.  I went the next day to back up my computer to be told it had already been shipped off.  When I hadn't heard anything on the tracking, I called to find out that my computer had NOT been sent off but was still in the store.  I asked about the backup, and I was told they had done one.  My computer left the store 14 days after I took it in because they ""didn't have shipping boxes available.""  The service center did not receive my computer for 9 more days. The diagnosis was made 15 days later. The repairs were made and the computer was shipped 7 days later and was ready for pick up 5 days after that.  When I picked up my computer, they had not uploaded the back up and said they would need it another day. The backup was supposedly done, and I picked up the computer.  It has NOTHING on it.  It's like brand new.  There was a folder called Geek Squad Back up that has a few files in it, but everything else is gone.  I would have at least backed up my documents had they not told me the computer was no longer in the store!  I am so irritated!  I have purchased at least 4 computers from Best Buy over the years, but I will probably not go back.

I apologized for ""interfering"" and Dr. Alpar continued to ask my daughter the same question. After the 5th time if repeating the question and not getting a response he rudely told her ""today"". My daughter didn't understand what he wanted. And later also told her to ""pay attention"" because shewas repeating him instead of answering his question; again she didn't fully understand.
