So we saw two tables outside that were open and with enough seats there, so we asked one of the waitresses if we could sit there and they told us yes, finally... It was then another 20 minutes before a waitress showed up to take our drink orders a beer and water for everyone... We only EVER got 4 waters, and when we reminded her that we still needed 3 more when she brought out the first few people's beer, she disappeared for another 10 minutes, and finally came back with the last two people's beers, but still no waters. Then she said she would be right back to take our food order... She arrives back to our daily about 10 minutes later again...

Lake Lawtonka,"Camped here for two nights. BEAUTIFUL views as you can see from the pictures attached. Nice campsites with a covered shelter and picnic table at each site. A couple things to note though.
1. There is only one bathroom. It is at the south end of the campground and looks like it hasn't been updated in 30+ years. The shower stalls do not have shower curtains or rods.
2. There is a VERY busy highway 100-200 feet away from all of the campsites. A lot of LOUD diesel trucks ROAR by here at all hours of day and night. So BRING EARPLUGS if you would like to be able to sleep at night! Especially if you are tent camping! I forgot mine the first night and slept horribly. The 2nd night I had bought some and they blocked out all the noise and I slept much better.
3. Each covered shelter has a light socket. It may or may not have a light bulb already in it. So bring your own and you won't have to use a lantern. There are circuit breakers for each site that control the electricity.
4. There are a lot of biting ant hills around the campground. We took rocks from the fire ring and placed one by each ant hill in and around our campsite so we would be able to see be aware of them day and night.

We came in at 6 and there were 2 other couples in there eating so they weren't busy. It took us forever to find a clean table and when the girl working there did finally come out and clean up I watched her wipe off 7 tables with the same rag and no cleaning solution!! Disgusting!! I have worked in restaurants and this is not acceptable. This should have been a clue when we pulled up to the restaurant the door to the kitchen was open to the outside and they were all standing around talking. The bathrooms were horrible as well. There was a bunch of hair in the sink of the ladies room and it looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months. The mens bathroom had no SOAP AND THE COOKS WERE MEN.
When we tried to place our order for the pepperolies and found out they were out again she never offered to tell us what the specials were to help us out. She was just a warm  body standing behind the counter. My husband ordered a salad and everything was low or out, the crackers were smashed and unusable. We ordered a thin crust pepperoni and it looked like a flatbread pizza, didnt know they had that. The cheese dippers were too brown and not tasty.

Schlotzsky's,"I have heard great things about their pizza and decided to order. The first time I ordered online, I got a lunch deal and they forgot the cookie and chips. An honest mistake. I didn’t worry about it. Ordered a second time the next week and they forgot them again. So that time I called and they replace the chips and cookies from both orders.
Ordered a 3rd time, 2 flatbreads and they game me 1 flatbread and a sandwich. Not even a Sandwhich with the ingredients I ordered on my pizza. I called and complained and they offered to remake my pizzas.
I waited 2 weeks and decided to call in for my remakes and once again they got it wrong. I asked for the chicken and avocado pizza with no red peppers. I got a chicken pizza with extra red pepper and no avocado. I ordered with a coworker and they messed up her order too this time.
At this point I’ve given up on them and I won’t be ordering again. Their food is good but they can’t seem to fill orders correctly and that’s frustrating. They can’t even do it correctly when they know they’re making a remake because it was screwed up the first time.
