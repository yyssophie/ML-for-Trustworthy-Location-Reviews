Jake's Automotive,"This is a long review, I hope you stick through it because it may help you decide on what makes a great mechanic versus a crappy one!

I had an air conditioner issue in the middle of summer.  Troy answered my call, was polite and extremely knowledgeable.  He was open to my input as I described the issue I had and was even patient with me as I tried to tell him more and more.  After calling around and getting hung up on I decided to call Jake's automotive back.  Troy answered and told me about the drop off overnight availability that they had there.

When I brought my car in on Sunday night to leave it, the car lot was full.  It was a good sign to me, showing that they had a lot of work.

Troy called me later that day to tell me what was wrong with my air conditioner.  He found a hole that punctured one of my lines and described the labor that was going to be involved.  I approved the order and he fixed it same day.  The shop closes at 5:30pm and he called me at 5:28pm letting me know it was ready for pick-up.

This sounds like a normal fix'r upper doesn't it?  Well, there is a reason why I have gone into so much detail.  Because it wasn't fixed.  I went in on Monday early evening and picked it up.  The A/C was working, but by the time I got home it was not.  I immediately called back and Troy answered the phone, clearly after they had closed.  He said he was working on something else and asked me to bring it back in.  He discovered that the charge of Freon in the system was too much.  He did not give any excuses, he just stayed late for me to drain it out and re-charge the Freon.  It was clearly a mistake, but it cost him, not me and I deeply appreciated the extra effort to make it right.  He could have just not answered the phone when I called him.

You see, I had a great mechanic before.  But he closed up shop when his dealership went out of business...and I had to find a new, honest mechanic.  Troy was GREAT and he has a customer for life!",Valid,"This is a detailed, genuine review describing the reviewer's specific experience with Jake's Automotive.

Austin was quick and as gentle as possible. When booking I was led to believe that the appointment for legs and bikini would take an hour and 15 minutes but I was pleasantly surprised to be in and out in less than 40.
The salon used a soft wax for the bikini area which is different than what I've had before but didn't seen to be as hot or painful if memory serves. I do have a couple of stragglers but that is more likely due to my hair than anything else. The one thing that I would say stuck out to me that I didn't really enjoy was a little lapse of privacy. The room that I was in is set up such that the table faces the door which opens onto a bright windowed hall which could potentially lead to a little awkward exposure.
Over all, I will be returning at least once more and then deciding from there.",Valid,"The review provides a detailed, genuine experience about a waxing service appointment.

Thousand Lakes RV Park,"This is the best RV park we have ever been.

The owners of Thousland Lakes RV Park are extremely friendly and helpful. They greeted us at the first night of arrival which contributed to a beautiful start to our long weekend getaway. The park in general has a very thoughtful layout. A green field in the middle of the park is surrounded by cabins, the tent sites and the RV parking lots. It resembles a meeting point and it is easy to make friends there (especially kids can roam around and play under the sight of their parents eyes). The pool is right next to it.

We stayed in a normal cabin over that weekend. Each cabin has its own fire pit, chairs&table inside as well as outside. The beds were comfortable and we had a beautiful view out of our back window.

The RV Park is meticulously clean and very well maintained. Visitors and staff are friendly and respectful. It was quiet at night even though plenty of kids were present during our visit. The RV park is conveniently close the national park, restaurants and a general store.

We have heard from friends complaining about WIFI which we personally did not use during our stay. The RV park offers Jeep rentals, a hair salon and a cute gift shop. We usually don't shop at gift shops but we found some beautiful things there (including a Christmas gift). I can highly recommend to visit the gift shop just because of the decorations, clothing and jewelry they sell there.

One improvement we can think of is the check-in process. Upon arrival, we have not received any information how the check-in procedure works. A recommendation here is, to send an info sheet along the confirmation email and put office/check-in hours on the website. The day of arrival, we tried to get a hold of the receptionist to receive more information about our check-in as we knew we would arrive after 10pm. We haven't heard anything back from them that day, neither via email or phone. Once we arrived, the reception was closed as expected. We found the trailer with the camp host who wasn't present and nobody answered the phone. After a while of looking around we saw little post-its with check in information on the door of the reception, so we could unlock the cabin by ourselves.",Valid,"This is a comprehensive, genuine review of an RV park experience.

He looked over at the table he had earlier taken ice cream cones to with a completely bewildered look on his face.  Clearly, he had taken our cones to the wrong table.

The Alloy at Geneva,"As a newer property, the Alloy is undergoing some growing pains--parking is scarce, the dog situation is kind of out of control, and the garbage problem (for us) has been difficult. I think the apartments are also grossly overpriced. However, maintenance is super on top of things when you call and management is responsive when you email or send them messages. If noise is a concern for you as it has been for us, perhaps an apartment away from the hubbub of everything would be better. We're right next to the clubhouse and the pool and the Alloy is BASICALLY student housing. So you're going to have noise from the pool and clubhouse at all hours of the night, and there's nothing you can do about it except rent a unit further away from where all the students gather to shirk adult responsibility. ;) It's really been a rough year but provided you read your lease carefully, realize what you're getting yourself into, and tack on an additional $200 to the rent they say you'll pay monthly, you'll probably like the Alloy. We're all alive and happy and as we near the end of our lease, that's about what we can hope for. :)",Valid,"The review provides a detailed, genuine experience of living at The Alloy apartment complex.

Roots Handmade Pizza - South Loop,"5 stars for: service, atmosphere, ambiance
3 stars for: pizza
10 stars: mozzarella sticks, alcoholic popsicles

Pros; It’s not often downtown you find a decent selection of wines for under $50, was super impressed with the bottle we got and it was $36. The rooftop is amazing, the venue is amazing!!! Open spaces, disco ball, awesome music and an all around perfect environment. The mozzarella sticks were TO DIE FOR CHEESE LOVERS BEWARE !! Huge mozz sticks packed with flavor and the menu didn’t lie, unforgettable! Alcoholic popsicles for dessert were a huge treat but I should have gone with the fruity pebble cheesecake WOW!

Pizza - a ton of specialty ethnic pizzas that are sure to please unique palettes. However, I was craving an authentic Italian pizza so that’s what I went with (garden pizza add sausage for a supreme pizza creation) and  was quite disappointed. Sausage lovers beware - the sausage is on the pizza like ground meat which was a huge turn off for me. Light sauce and the cheese would pretty lightly cooked so it didn’t give that mooey gooey feel. Other pizzas that came out looked great and the staff was more than willing to make us a new one which I appreciated but it just wasn’t our vibe. I would come back and try something else next time!! Overall great visit and would recommend.",Valid,"This is a detailed, genuine review of a dining experience at Roots Handmade Pizza.

Beatrix,"Highly recommend Beatrix!

We came on a Saturday night for one of my best friends birthday dinner celebration. I strongly recommend making a reservation! To get seated, make sure your party is there. You can make reservations through OpenTable and collect those points!

During the pandemic, they closed “w Fulton market” street and all of the restaurants have outdoor seating and pods available. I thought this was a great idea and it’s going to be so nice for warmer weather nights in the Chi. We did sit inside. All staff did have on mask and hand sanitizer is available. Guests are required to wear masks while in the restaurant, masks are required during all interactions with the service team and only to be removed when eating or drinking. Before seating, all guest did have our temperature checked. They have digital menus and it does say On their menu, to help offset restrictions on their business resulting from the pandemic, there is a a 5% surcharge added to the check. Similar to other restaurants you can let them know if you want it removed.

The ambiance is chic, dimmed lighting and the space is well-decorated. I loved the light fixtures, I’m weird! The tables were spaced apart, so we didn’t feel as if we were on top of anyone which was nice. The chairs for the round table were ether cushioned or non, all very comfortable.

They had a great selection of beverages and wine list. My friends and I all participated in the restaurant week menu. This is $39 per person and the dinner menu is available daily after 4:00PM. You get to select one of their starters, entrees and dessert, as well as one their cocktails listed. This was such a great deal and I highly recommend to take advantage of it! The portions were perfect for one person or even if you wanted to share so the other guest can order something different too.

In our party, for the starters we tried their hummus which came with a delicious fresh tomatoes and cucumber salad, flavorful hummus and warm naan. I was hesitant about combining the cold tomatoes on top of the hummus/naan, but it was so delicious! We also tried their local burrata with roasted beets and crispy quinoa. I am personally not a beets person, but two of our friends in our party enjoyed it. The only con was, they wanted more of the bread.

For entrees, one of our friends tried their Cavatelli with chicken bolognese and the remaining of our party ordered the skirt steak chimichurri. Both dishes were cooked perfectly and had flavor, they were delicious! The skirt steaks came with fries and grilled shishito peppers. The peppers were a good combo with the steak as they were bit smoky, but they didn’t have spice to them. I do enjoy spice, so I would have liked that, but even so still a delicious combination. The entrees were a good size portion, good to eat alone or again to share (COVID friendly of course).

For dessert, we tried their oh my! Carmel pie, and the pie definitely fits the name. Oh my, oh my, it was fantastic. I am normally not a caramel person and when I first saw the pie I was like oh great look how thick this is I’m not going to eat it and it is complete opposite! It was so smooth and creamy! And the shortbread cookie crust was my favorite part. We also tried their chocolate cake which was very heavy, but delicious! I highly recommend either dessert, and the side of whip cream I would say it is, but obviously made better was very much appreciated!

Our server was fantastic, sadly I didn’t get his name and I don’t have my Receipt. He was very friendly and made sure we were good all night. Since my friend did not want a  candle for her birthday or to sing, he did give my friend a to-go dessert which was very sweet and made her feel special.",Valid,"This is a comprehensive and genuine review of a dining experience at Beatrix.

Weegee's Lounge,"One of those places in your neighborhood you ask yourself, ‘Why has it taken me so long to come here?’ Weegee’s is perfect.

My partner and I dropped in on a weekday for a cocktail and ended up having two rounds on account of how much we enjoyed our first. Our bartender was awesome.

I had the Corpse Reviver #2 since I’ve been on a gin kick lately. I gotta say, this might be my nee favorite cocktail within .5 miles of my apartment. That’s dangerous.

My partner was sipping on some delicious whiskey cocktails. Their cocktail menu will hit the spot for any variety of drinker. They have beer, too, if I’m not mistaken.

For my second round, the very helpful bartender suggested a similar cocktail that used to be on their menu for me since I wanted to mix it up and stick with a similar gin recipe. It was equally well-made yet didn’t excite me like the first cocktail. I love the use of fresh ingredients, premium spirits and thoughtful recipes.

It was quiet when we went, which was nice, actually.

The Vegas Café,"It is a classic in Antioch. If you've been here for a little bit of time you've probably heard of the Vegas before. It is a no frills diner best for breakfast.

Make sure everyone in your group is ready to be seated, they won't seat you otherwise.

For what you are getting the food is a little over priced. Smaller portions than back in the day that made the place popular. The service is always rushed, not much you can do about that with every table filled.

The Centre for Oral Surgery in Joliet,"This was an absolutely amazing experience!  My oldest son needed 4 impacted molars removed, and I was not pleased with the reviews of the places recommended by his dentist and orthodontist and found this place myself.

They were incredibly thorough in making sure they had all the paperwork, x-rays and other models before the event.  We were given a care package prior to the surgery (something we purchased) to assist in reducing the swelling and to clean the wounds.

We had a meeting prior to the surgery which covered everything that was going to happen with a clear outline of the process, paper work, and billing.

The day itself was so smooth it was amazing.  We arrived a little before the scheduled time, my son was seen around 20 minutes later, and the surgery itself was estimated to be 45 minutes and it was.  We were in an out much quicker than I had expected.  In addition to that, I was able to get all necessary meds at a vending machine (InstyMeds) after the surgery very easily.

My son had a headwrap for the ice packs, we were given extra gauze, chapstick for the  chapped lips that occur during the procedure, extra ice packs, documentation to go home, and even a blanket to take with us!  Anesthesia can give you the shivers so that was an amazing touch.  We received meds for the pain, anti biotics, and meds to help the swelling, which should make this process as pleasant as one can hope to expect.

Our appointment was at 8:40 and I believe we were home before 11!  Very efficient in every detail!

"Tonic Smoke Shop, Vape, CBD, Kratom, Puff Bars (Sacramento)","I live very close to this shop and drive by its location daily; because I noticed the sign on the building from Tonic, I thought to myself, ""That's a new sign and I think Tonic is a shisha brand. I'll stop in very soon and check it out!"" Stopping in is just what I did!

Upon entering, I noticed many hookahs and hookah accessories lining the wall on the left. Hookahs were set up in the middle of the store on tables and it seems as though you can smoke out of them. I didn't ask the guys working if that was what those particular ones were for because I seriously was more interested in finding a new shisha flavor to try out. I had a nice young man help me and I swear he looks just like the comedian Gabriel Iglesias! Anyways, he helped me and I smelled some recommended flavors. I ended up taking home 100g of Purple Mermaid to try out - if I really like it, next time I'll buy a 200g can. He was also nice enough to show me the Tonic brand hookahs that they have. I truly needed to buy a new hookah to replace my current one that has a rusted stem so I ended up buying a Tribes hookah for $35!!! That's right my friends, $35 for a nice sized hookah! The great thing is, Tonic hookahs come with a year warranty in case something happens to your hookah! Score! There are many more hookah accessories in a smaller room in the back of the store and they carry many brands of natural charcoals like Coco Nara and Coco Mazaya. I love this place so much as a hookah smoker and I've visited only once!

Hollywood Sign,"(Translated by Google) 2010-2016
Head west on Franklin Avenue from Griffith Observatory and head north on Beachwood Drive
After passing the beachwood market, take the alley to the left and continue climbing to reach this place.
Since there is not much space to stop the car, you will have to wait for a while if you are behind the customer.
If you go deeper than that, it will get in the way of the residents, so please refrain from doing so.
There is also a hiking trail that goes behind the sign, but if you like time and walking, that might be a good choice.
If you stand behind the letter H, you may be able to relive the pessimism of British actress Peg Entwistle, who committed suicide by throwing himself, which is one of the reasons why the letter LAND is removed from this sign.

Julie was also one of the best servers we have come across and she was very knowledgeable about past and current entertainment venues right there at the whiskey barrel.

HuHot Mongolian Grill,"I will say my husband loves this place because you mix your own stir fry and he can make it as spicy as he wants. And the service was great. But if it wasn't for that, I would rate it lower because it was very dirty: multiple food containers were empty and every raw food container had food from the others mixed in. In addition, the fry cooks just scrape their spatulas on the edge of the grill after mixing each order—there was fried gunk and bits of food everywhere. I was very concerned about contamination (especially with the flash-fry method that may not cook everything completely).
In the sauce area, the plastic shield does not allow enough room to tip the ladles into your bowl, so sauce is spilled everywhere, including into the original sauce containers.
So, if your goal is making your own food and you don't care about cross-contamination, you will probably like it.

Ranchman's 23 Saloon and Steakhouse,"We arrived around 1130. We ordered 2 appetizers ( mozz sticks and spin dip). The apps were good the spin dip came with some soft garlic bread which was good.

We ordered steak with grilled shrimp and eggs with biscuits and gravy with a side of fruit. The fruit came out extremely early (before our apps were finished) and was clearly over ripe and had gone bad. The fruit had hit a fizzy sour phase. The gravy on the biscuits and gravy is canned or just a poor rendition of what sausage gravy should be.  The steak supposed to be med rare came out med well. The shrimp was over cooked to the point of chewy.

Prime rib sandwich with chips, onion rings, garlic mash and with 2 eggs and toast. The potatoes were a boiled potato that had no flavor. The chips were hit and miss raw and flavorless with some full on burnt. The eggs and toast never came.

Biscuits and gravy, eggs and sausage links. The eggs were supposed to be over easy but they were almost over hard. The sausage links never came.

Our empty appetizer plates sat on the table for quite a time. They were not busy. Our drinks often sat empty. Our waitress had a poor attitude and often responded as though we were troublesome for asking for our missing food ( eggs, sausage links and toast). She also slammed our plates onto the table when she was delivering food. We asked twice for our check before we got it. I had to ask twice and argue with the waitress over our check being incorrect as they were still charging us for the food we never received and the fruit which I told her twice that was bad. I ended up having to open a dispute with my banking institution.

The final thought the food was poorly made, over cooked and outright over its good date on some. The service was lackluster and poor. The price given all of these short comings is appallingly high. Our bill was also incorrect and when pointed out I was told that no it was fine it was just out of order.  I wouldn’t recommend stopping in for some food. There is a small diner about 15 minutes down the road that is cheaper with better service.

We pulled up to the window, and I didn't realize B3 came with soda, so I apologized and asked for coffee instead. She tells me the total which is $14 and some change. When we get our food, I drive off, but realize the bag is pretty light. So I have my daughter look in the bag and realize we only have the 2 burritos and donuts.
I decide to call and make sure that we were supposed to receive potato oles, to which the lady replies ""well if you would look at your receipt, it will tell you how it was rung up""  I didn't get a receipt, I didn't think I needed it. She did confirm that B1 and B3 should have come with oles, but the drive through attendant rung them up separate....
Ok so...can we come back to get the oles or will I have to pay more?  (Because $14 for 2 burritos, a cup of donuts, 2 coffees & an orange juice isn't expensive or anything)  She responds with ""Um, well, I guess you can get some for the inconvenience""

Buffalo Wild Wings,"I had a good time at BWW and as i was sitting there i noticed three employees, two females and i one of the males, standing next to the in and out door by the bar talking, and it didn’t sound like it was professional talk. And they were speaking loud enough for the people at the bar and the people at the bar table to hear. Not very professional especially in a restaurant business. I do want to give a shout out to our server and one if the male employees there. Veronica is amazing especially with waiting tables. She remembered all of what we wanted, checked up on us frequently, refilled our drinks. Great work. And Reese, i saw him carrying towers of cups, i assume clean, and is bussing tables and sweeping the floors and carrying dishes to the back to be cleaned. Veronica and Reese are hard workers and i think they deserve a raise. I appreciate hard workers like that, i use to work in the restaurant industry and i know workers who work their butts off, instead of talking loudly in an attitude tone, or going over to front desk area to show a couple more employees something funny on their phone. Thats not acceptable, even if the employee isn’t on shift while others are, thats not okay. Food is great.

Flippin' Family Fun,Not a good place to book your kids party🥳 very unorganized! They no longer do Pizza Hut or water bottles like websites says. Do not encourage you to come sign up before the party and have all people in party sign up. Jump time starts when your party starts doesn’t matter if wristbands are on or not. I had a lady enter every kid one by one on a tablet and it took her almost an hour to get everyone done honestly! She could have suggested to use the tablets on the wall! That would have made things go a lot faster or for instance calling after I paid the deposit and instead of telling me about paper plates they provide I wish she was would have told me about needing all family and jumpers to be signed up before arriving if they have never been here before. When I tried to give them tips just so others wouldn’t experience the what I did they became angry instead of understanding. It was 210$ for the party! One hour of jump time rest time we had to be in a room which was fine if we actually got close to hour of jump time. I never asked for a discount or anything just let them know how they should have let me know that when I put the deposit down or when they called. When I addressed the taller and older man he informed me that I was talking about his wife. Literally said no offense but that’s my wife! All I was asking for was common courtesy. Their work and home relationship should be kept separate so they aren’t rude to customers in incidents like this. He proceeded to argue with me the entire time about how it’s my fault they lost out on jumping time like it isn’t even a big deal and I thought the customer is always right! I never said I was not going to pay! I only way letting you know what you could do in the future to prevent another customer from becoming upset. This is why you dating co workers doesn’t work out and in this case they are married. I shouldn’t be at fault just because I offended his wife for making suggestions. I have experience in this type of stuff and I’m a mother who loves a perfect party! I do one every year and have yet to be disappointed. Bottom line is you just never have a male customer talk to a female that way it was embarrassing I felt like I was being scolded. At that point the lady didn’t come back into party room for the rest of the time or even spoke a word to us. They delivered the pizzas from their oven. Left us with no cups and pictures of water. I hosted my own party that’s for sure and could have got people to sign in a lot quicker! Thought it would be helpful to have a host but instead it made things go much slower than anticipated.,Valid,"This is a detailed review describing a genuine experience at a children's party venue.

True Food Kitchen,"Didnt have the best take out experience today which is odd because I've been coming here since it opened and I love the food.  First off, I called and when the young lady answered she said she had to transfer me to the bar.  Not bad but I thought the bar phone rang when you called in.  She put me on hold, where I stayed for 5 minutes so I hung up, called back and she transfered me again and I put in my order.  When I got in to pick it up I saw a carry out bag sitting at the bar so I went to sit in front of it figuring it was mine.  The bar tender, a tall slender caucasian guy caught eye contact with me, walked around to the other side of the bar, poured some water, then walked back and was like ""Oh I didnt even hear you come in"".  As if the direct eye contact he gave me when I came in wasnt enough for him to know I was there, I was also wearing loud cowboy boots and it wasnt hardly anyone in the restaurant.  The only person who wouldnt have noticed me come in wouldve been someone blind and deaf.    Some other young ladies came over to the bar and he told them to check the order to make sure it was mine...  What was wrong with him making sure it was mine.  He was literally doing nothing.  I sensed it was some tense energy in there surrounding this guy because the other young ladies had frustrated looks on their faces.  I paid for my food and left and as I was walking away he loudly and sarcastically greated someone else.  I had my food at that point but did want to make sure I set aside time to write this review because whatever is going on with the guy at the bar today, tall slender caucasian guy, he seems to be rubbing everyone, including me, a paying customer, the wrong way.  The food is always good, I wouldve given 5 stars otherwise.  I'll make sure not to come in for a while so hopefully I'm not ""served/helped"" by that guy next time I come in.

Phở Apple,"Very good Pho! It's all about the broth, and it has all the flavor it needs. The cuts of steak were high quality (not chewy strips of scrap meats like some places will put in) and the meatballs were amazing. The spring rolls are also great and the only small gripe that I can muster up is that the meat portions seemed a touch on the light side in both the Pho and the BBQ pork spring rolls. Not to say that the portions were small, it just seems like the dish would have been perfectly balanced with a little more protein. This is definitely a quality over quantity issue though and I will certainly be back for the Pho and to see what else is on the menu!

Grand Lux Cafe,"I used to live in NY, and this restaurant quickly became an all time favorite. I then moved to Texas and a few years later found this location in Austin. I was so excited as I missed the incredible food, deserts, and service I experienced in NY. However I became quickly disappointed. The food was still decencompared to other restaurants and the service wasn't awful, compared to other restaurants. But neither are what I have known and come to expect from a Grand Lux. This place is rather pricey. It's one of those places you go to treat yourself or small family once in a very blue moon. However the quality of food and level of service were not worth the price from this experience. Myself, husband, and best friend went together as I wanted to bring them to the amazing restaurant I knew in NY. We were quickly seated. However the decor was outdated and felt as if we were sitting in one of those hotel restaurants where not much thought is given to decor because the restaurant is really there out of convenience. My friend and I ordered brunch drinks. The drinks themselves tasted decent but not $10-$11 dollars a glass decent and they were very very small. The bloody Mary was served in a rather small glass with tons of ice. Mine was served in a small champagne glass. Neither had any traceable amounts of alcohol in them... like I said, they were tasty, but not worth the gouged price. Our waiter quickly checked back in to see if we were ready to order. We ordered but that was the last we saw of him until the end of the meal. Three separate people delivered our food at different times. We were never prompted or asked about desert when our order was taken. This place makes several things to order and take roughly 30 minutes, so your waiter needs to put in the order at the beginning. Let me tell you, the desserts from Grand Lux are to die for, but we were never asked or able.to order them, so I can only speak from my experience at the NY location. My friend ordered the lunch omelet with a side salad. It came out with hash browns and no salad. The waitress delivering it quickly apologized and took it back for her. However another 15-20 minutes went by before it came back out. I shared my Asian tacos from the tapas menu while we waited. They were yummy. I also ordered mini crab cakes (my husband's favorite) and tuna ceviche but was told after the fact they were out of the ceviche. Which was okay ultimately, as I became full very quickly, but it would have been helpful if my waiter was aware of any menu changes in the beginning. My husband ordered butter garlic shrimp pasta. The sauce was good but the shrimp weren't cleaned properly. They had sand in them, were gritty, and not deveined. We finally saw our waiter again once we were finished. He offered to box our food up to go which we said yes. My tacos and crab cakes were both supposed to have sauce. At the NY restaurant I go to they always included an extra to go cup of whatever sauce your food came with. This waiter did not. The food was good but the sauce definitely doesn't all together as it should with any decent meal. Like I said, it would have been good if I were going to a restaurant like cheddars. However this is the Grand Lux. For our simple meal for three people (and my two very small plates coming from a tapas menu), our bill was well over $100. This is not the type of food or experience I would expect for the name or the price and I am highly disappointed. To add insult to injury the food made me, my friend and husband very sick that night. It was the only thing we ate all day and the only meal we have ever had in common in over a month. My friend lives in Austin and I live by Fort Hood. So there is no way and highly unlikely it camfrom something else we ate. I would highly doubt the possibility of me ever returning here. I guess I will have to wait on the rare trip if ever, I go back to NY to visit a Grand Lux again.",Valid,"This is a detailed, genuine review of a dining experience at Grand Lux Cafe.

Best Buy,"I am extremely frustrated with the Geek Squad service I have received.  I took my computer in on July 29.  I was told they would have to send the computer off to a service center for repairs, so I should come in to back it up.  I went the next day to back up my computer to be told it had already been shipped off.  When I hadn't heard anything on the tracking, I called to find out that my computer had NOT been sent off but was still in the store.  I asked about the backup, and I was told they had done one.  My computer left the store 14 days after I took it in because they ""didn't have shipping boxes available.""  The service center did not receive my computer for 9 more days. The diagnosis was made 15 days later. The repairs were made and the computer was shipped 7 days later and was ready for pick up 5 days after that.  When I picked up my computer, they had not uploaded the back up and said they would need it another day. The backup was supposedly done, and I picked up the computer.  It has NOTHING on it.  It's like brand new.  There was a folder called Geek Squad Back up that has a few files in it, but everything else is gone.  I would have at least backed up my documents had they not told me the computer was no longer in the store!  I am so irritated!  I have purchased at least 4 computers from Best Buy over the years, but I will probably not go back.

There were employees sitting on the floor playing on their phones instead of helping customers, just a horrible experience, would have given one star but our waitress was cool so I gave two.

Two Men and a Truck,"So torn.

On the one hand, the guy who came by afterwards and repaired some of the minor damage was great. On the other hand, the moving experience itself was horrible.

I had a 3 bed 1 bath house moving to a 3 bed 2 bath house. I had 2 bedroom sets, an office, a full living room, 15 boxes, 10 bags, and 3 appliances to move. The distance between locations was under 2 miles. We were quoted 4-5hrs.

The last moving company I hired did a move from baton rouge to Denham with the same contents in under 4hrs with travel time.

The two men that turned up dragged their feet every opportunity they could. They kept closing the truck wanting to move to the 2nd house when the 1st house still had contents to be moved. They kept taking on-the-clock breaks. They kept losing hardware for disassembled furniture.

I literally had to keep stating ""everything but the fridge and oven needs to be on the truck"" but they still failed to load up all of the soft materials, appliances, etc, on the first trip. They packed so stupidly they had to make 2 trips.

On the first trip, to the new location, they left the same time as me and somehow took an additional 15 minutes driving the 1 mile to the new house. They forgot the bed hardware at the old house. After unloading the truck, I had to send they put the furniture where I asked them to put it and not just drop it in the center of the room.

I then had to bribe them to make a 2nd trip to retrieve the 10 bags, 2 missed appliances, and a bunch of other small items. Again, I had to keep reminding them I'm paying for their time and I needed everything moved, everything. They kept closing the truck, again. They kept walking past items, stating rooms were empty when plastic crates and PCs were sitting in the middle of the floor. 6hrs after the move started, I finally managed to get nearly everything into the new house.

Of course, we went back and retrieved stuff like the dryer vent line, the microwave, two more boxes, and two baskets with electronics that were missed on both the first and second trip.

The manager who turned up 3 days after the move apologized for the men, and repaired some of the damages. He cut a check for $165 to offset damages to a coffee table that looked like the guys used as a dance floor.

Today, I finally had a reason to start looking at hanging my 55"" 4k Samsung TV. To my horror, I just found not one, but 3 decent scratches on the glass. Here's hoping 2 men and a truck can cover those damages too.u

Thank God they took off the price for one person at our 3 top, since she ate literally nothing.  Since it's all you can eat special they bring you the nastiest smallest portions of food they can find for example the beef teriyaki we ordered 3 thinking it would be nice little single portions maybe 2 oz of steak each, in this case to feed one person they give you 3 cut up pieces! Yep you read that right yes 3 to 4 PIECES of steak (LESS THAN .2 OZ)  that is red ,raw has blood on plate and cannot be chewed as it is all fat. 🤮🤮 The sushi I ordered was not what I wanted apparently snow crab roll is gone and everything else they had sushi wise looked very old and not appetizing at all. here I am at 8:30 making dinner at home after sitting there for one whole hour trying to get the hell out -I will never ever ever be back!",Valid,"This is a detailed review describing a genuine dining experience at the Japanese restaurant.

The Grand Lafayette,"Update: 4 years and another lazy, half-hearted remodel later, I still keep wishing this chain would just fold and be replaced by any other theater chain. Still the same cruddy screens and terrible sound. Now with reclining seats in maybe half the theaters! Yay.

Original review:
This location underwent a lackluster, half-hearted remodel (the chairs are nice, the colors are not) that failed to replace aged, stained and otherwise damaged screens. The audio in most of the theaters substitutes volume for a quality and fidelity that is sorely lacking. Following the remodel, the size of the popcorn containers was reduced considerably while the price was most decidedly not, and the quality seems to have declined as well (this coming from a movie theater popcorn junkie). The Grand 16 makes me wish for another chain to come to town every time I attend. Their monopoly on Lafayette cinema had allowed them to get away with a steady decline in every measure of quality and, frankly, I see far more movies for the first time on Vudu or Blu-ray now as a result.",Valid,"The review provides a detailed and genuine experience about visiting this movie theater location.

Valvoline Instant Oil Change,"Usually I will give 5 stars for this location and its crew. Im undecided as of now 😕.
We had an oil change, new air filter and a serpentine belt replacement suggested by associate. It has been a week roughly and have noticed something like the sound of a rattling bolt under the hood near the serpentine belt when in idle especially.
My car smelled like something was burning this morning and my 6 year old also relies on this car for transportation so I took my car back to have this resolved and move forward at least tighten down the rattle. Which did not have that sound or issue before. They took a look but were reluctant to get in there and tighten it down and mentioned to bring it back Thursday when a more experienced associate or the manager would be there.
Until then I am concerned to continue driving my car to and from work without anything done physically to correct it. We have been going here for years. Until this is corrected I will leave it as blank star and then gladly change it. I just hope nothing bad happens while we have to drive it.

Update ...Went back to see manager he went above and beyond to help correct or figure out why or what may be the problem. It appears to either be the HV clutch or a bearing. Next bet will be to see a mechanic.

Jefferson Mall,"I tried reaching out to mall management with a complaint about one of the kiosk vendors today but the form on their website isn't working and they don't have a contact email, so I'll put it here instead. Early today, while walking through this mall, I had an off-putting experience with one of the kiosk vendors that I felt I should make known to mall management. I was walking past the Deep Sea Cosmetic kiosk, when the vendor grabbed me by the hand, turned me around and placed a sample product into my hand. He did not ask me or even address me at any point before this. HE DIDN'T EVEN SPEAK TO ME BEFORE TOUCHING ME. He just grabbed me (while I was walking alone through the mall), put the loose product into my hand (despite my raising concerns about allergens because I have severe topical allergies to many products). He then steered me over to the kiosk. He offered to do a demonstration with the product and I declined. At this point, he directed me to put my hands over a bowl so he could remove the product he had put there. Once I was there, he proceeded with the demonstration anyway. He would not listen to my repeated refusal or my questions about allergies. After drying my hands off, he proceeded to ring me up for products that I had not asked for and had refused many times--MORE THAN $100 IN PRODUCT THAT I HAD OUTRIGHT REFUSES. I continued to refuse and--after attempting to persuade me by lowering the price--he then slammed the register closed and began to make rude comments about my clothes and appearance. The experience made me extremely uncomfortable, and I feel this goes beyond the line of just a pushy salesman. There is no reason that salesman should be grabbing women--by their hand or otherwise--as they are walking alone through the mall. I clearly refused the demonstration and the product MANY times (to the extent that a salesperson at another kiosk nearby ended up interceding and asking the man to leave me alone) but he persisted. My hands are now very irritated and sore. Fortunately, the reactions I have are normally only topical, but that may not have been the case for someone else.",Valid,"This is a detailed, genuine review describing a specific negative experience at Jefferson Mall involving a kiosk vendor.

Valvoline Instant Oil Change,"Zero stars would be more appropriate.

I said that’s fine and he kept it moving. THEN THE RECOMMENDATIONS......There were 3, two of which he said can only be done at Volvo...Cool....but then he said that.... get this....my check engine light is recommending a power steering flush that they in fact CAN do there for me......... I immediately got offended considering that my VOLVO HAS ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING! His face was absolutely priceless when he learned that I knew this! Then when I got my total and the oil filter that he said was $3.99 was really $7.99 and I called him out on it.....do you think he offered to fix it or even own his mistake!? Nope he just justified it with the fact that oh ya know I drive one of those foreign cars! Nope I don’t know how the emblem on my car made you completely lie to me and attempt to take advantage!

Malone's Lansdowne,My husband and I made reservations at the wrong Malones! We drove 2 hours so we assumed it was just as fantastic as the other malone restaurants and kept our reservation. Our crab cocktail was amazing as usual. The waiter was fast kind and efficient. The long island ice tea tasted like there was no alcohol in it so switched to water. We both ordered steaks medium rare. They both came pretty done. Unfortunately we had to send them back which we never do and both felt awkward about but the manager was very kind and took care of us. Although it was still a very pleasant evening for us we did have impeccable service and food at a different location and will probably choose the other malones in the future!,Valid,"The review describes a genuine dining experience at the restaurant, including specific details about food items (crab cocktail, steaks), service quality, and interaction with staff.
