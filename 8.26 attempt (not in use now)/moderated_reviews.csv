The Local Kitchen & Ale,"Quick Post: 5 star!!! Loved it, and will definitely be back!

Long post: I visited this place back when they first opened, and even though it was good, I wasn't impressed with the options given and with a picky husband it was hard to select. Husband and I decided to try it last night. I had learned that they changed their menu up. Let me just say this place was top notch. I already knew the atmosphere was nice and cozy, made you feel relaxed and comfortable. We walked in feeling like we were welcome and appreciated! We both opted for the pasta dishes, him the spaghetti and me the alfredo, both came with side salads and we chose an extra order of the garlic knots. This food y'all! Let me tell you! IT WAS AMAZING! I am Italian and can be picky about my pasta dishes. Both dishes were just full of flavor and substance! The Alfredo was creamy and just perfect! The noodles were cooked to perfection! They were not crunchy and they didn't just fall apart in your mouth. My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs, again the noodles cooked to perfection, and the sauce was great! The meatballs were huge and cooked all the way through. The portions were big, one could easily leave with leftovers. Not us though, way to good to stop eating it! I love that they had other finger food options if you just wanted a snack and a beer. Or you could do the pasta for a nice date night, like the husband and I chose.  I can not say enough about this place! The prices were reasonable especially for what we got, and the owner was so nice. I kinda stuck my foot in my mouth when i asked if he had been there since they opened because i didn't care for the menu before. He politely said yes he didn't have a choice since he was the owner. lol Oh my! oops! he then explained how much time and effort he has put into this establishment hiring a chef from culinary school and revamping the menu to meet needs and cut down waste. Ya'll!!! It was great! Thank you Local Kitchen & Ale for sticking it out. I will be back!",Valid,"This is a detailed, genuine review describing multiple visits to the restaurant.

Sonic Drive-In,We were dining out front and they cut the lights out on my family without warning.

I'm sure there are a few of you that will say"" uh uh shu i be done down shifted and drove up outta theya""  nope not true because depending on what position you are in that you're not able to back up when someone gets behind you or do you not able to turn and go around the people in front of you just because of how carelessly the drive-thru was designed but to top it all off maybe you could get lucky and not end up like two and a half weeks ago when I went there and they were as a guy that hit passed out drunk and drive through one car away from the microphone and shut his car off and everything because he thought he was in his driveway I had to pack in front of that guy and back back up to the microphone 15 minutes later I got to the window and asked if they knew there was a man passed out in their drive-thru the woman at the window told me oh really he is probably drunk he probably sleeping cuz he's so drunk but 24 minutes is about up thanks for asking my thoughts and opinions on Whataburger Fultondale Alabama.

Asian House,"I was craving some veggie / hibachi fried rice today and wound up here to try their carry out.  I was definitely pleased with my experience!

Located in a large shopping center with Publix and Champy's, on what I'd consider the Huntsville/Madison cusp, this restaurant seems to do mostly takeout even in non-Covid times.  Looks like there was a table or two to sit at back in those times, but Asian House is carry out only for now, and the dining area is cordoned off by a large table.  Staff members also speak to you from behind a barrier.  The lady I spoke with was masked and wearing gloves at the time of my visit, so all in all great Covid precautions.

I placed my order over the phone as I was headed out of my house.  The man taking it repeated it back to me accurately, took my phone number, and told me it would be 10-15 minutes.  My food was ready when I arrived about 15 minutes later, so that was great!

The lady who bagged up my food and took my payment was so sweet and pleasant.  She double checked my order, thanked me for coming in, and wished me a nice afternoon.  She also made sure to ask if I needed any forks, napkins, etc with my meal.

I was very pleased and impressed with the price:  two regular sized entrees and an appetizer for $21!  There was more than enough food to fill us up.  It stayed warm and the fried stuff relatively crispy on the way home.

I had my aforementioned vegetable hibachi, boyfriend got sesame chicken, and we split the gyoza.  The gyoza is pan fried, with one side rather crispy and the other still that pleasing, slightly chewy texture.  It was noted as pork gyoza on the menu, and for once, I could actually taste the flavors of the meat!  Sometimes I feel like gyoza gets a sort of generic vegetable-y flavor, but this one didn't.  Soy dipping sauce was standard but tasty.

Boyfriend described his sesame chicken as ""standard sesame chicken, which is not a bad thing.""  I tasted it and would agree.  The chicken came in large pieces and it wasn't overly sauced.  I noticed the chicken pieces seemed to be all white meat, which I prefer.  My veggie hibachi was really good!  It had broccoli, squash, mushrooms, peas, carrots, and onions.  Little heavy on the onions for me, but I picked around the excess.  Veggies were cooked well.  The shining star of both of our meals was the fried rice -- it was delicious!  Had that lovely slightly smoky quality to it that comes with the perfect balance of soy sauce and sesame oil.  Whatever you get, make sure it comes with fried rice!  My only regret is not asking for a little bit more yum yum sauce to pour on top.

AT&T Store,"AT&T  3 days ago (Saturday) I moved a few miles down the road to an apartment complex that is wired exclusively for one internet provider, @AT&T. Prior to moving I was told by a AT&T customer service that since the building is already wired for AT&T, all I needed to do was take my router with me and plug it in at my new apartment. I double checked, “are you sure?”, to which I was again assured that it was just that simple. Several days later I move and plug the router in. No internet. I call AT&T and tell them what happened, and they scheduled a technician to come to my apartment several days later (Tuesday) to activate my service. It’s Tuesday night now, so I call and ask when I can expect to see the tech. After a long process of being put on hold and transferred to a “manager”, I’m told that I didn’t actually have an appointment. Even worse, they told me that it would be THREE WEEKS until they’d be able to get someone out to my apartment. I live in downtown Birmingham, a relatively big city, and they don’t have a single tech that can spend 20 minutes activating my internet service. Are you kidding me AT&T? What if I worked from home, or if I had a kid who was learning remotely? What if I caught covid and couldn’t leave for 2 weeks but still had to work? I literally have no other options besides using AT&T and they know this. I was misled multiple times by their representatives, then told to wait for nearly a month for a service I ALREADY PAY FOR.
